70,80,1,7054,"Been to almost all the buffets in Vegas.  This one is the best.  quality quality quality.  They have everything that most great buffets do.  However, the quality was a step above.  They have great chefs working in the back and the food shows.  The attention to detail, the seasoning, the searing, the temperature...all on point."
92,106,1,7382,"I so far have made only one transaction with Scottsdale Guns-So far...\nI will for sure be back!! Craig  took care of  my order.  It was just a couple of magazines\nfor my SCAR 17 .308 rifle, but he did an excellent job of communications with email and telephone follow up work! could not ask for better service than this!  Thanks for the help, Craig,!  And I will deffinantly be buying from them in the future."
160,174,1,6814,"They have changed their name to Eforea. Bought a groupon when I found out we were gonna stay at this Hilton, what a deal!\nI was kind of surprised at how small this facility is. There was no jacuzzi inside. They only have the one outside for all guests, but it was cold and raining so we couldn't use it.\nLounge area seats about 12 people. It's not the type of spa that you could spend many hours in. Steam room was really nice. They also have a nail salon.\nIf I had paid full price I would have been disappointed. I've gotten other treatments at hotels on the strip and they have huge facilities that you could send all day in with indoor jacuzzis and multiple types of steam rooms lots of snacks, drinks and reading material."
28,29,1,2088,Again my nails look great. Katie is the girl to see!Check out the last pic. That's my nails! Thanks Katie
51,55,1,39,"Get the pasta trio, you won't regret it.  Big heaping portions of fresh pasta delivered to your plate as soon as you have space available. Mmm.  And we went on a Saturday night with no reservations and we're seated in 5 minutes."
64,99,1,7495,"Meilleure resto de poutine pour les garnitures variees et les grosses portions! Les frites ecrasees sont trop bonnes, mais la sauce est ordinaire. Le reste sur le menu est pas mal, j'ai essaye les burgers et rien a redire! \n\nMon conseil, manger une poutine sur mesure! Ca vaut la peine."
14,15,1,1076,mark & mercedes are a must listen to in the morning.
48,52,1,9457,"If you are looking for the best apartments in Scottsdale, I would definitely recommend Liv North Scottsdale. The staff is so nice and helpful. I would give them a call to be put on the list for when they open this fall!"
82,87,1,7927,"AMAZING! I have had massages before but none like this, I found this place on groupon and everyone warns me that you get what you pay for but Jesse was simply amazing. There were some points during the massage where I couldn't tell where he was standing and it felt like he had 6 hands. Might sound too good to be true but my stuff shoulders feel great, I will defiantly be returning!"
146,157,1,4700,"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said?? Easily the best food I've had in Montreal. I had the mac & cheese, which was perfect. The mushrooms gave it a wonderful savory taste and the texture was something I didn't know I wanted until I had it. The accompanying salad was light enough on the dressing and very, very fresh. Well worth the trip downtown for me and I will be back.\n\nThe only issue was price. My lunch for one of the mac and cheese, a small soda, and an almond croissant came to about $21. There was a lunch rush but as a single, I didn't have to wait at all for a seat at the counter."
42,49,1,5537,Best sandwiches in Las Vegas! Awesome choices and completely customizable. Don't forget an order of fresh cut potato chips or fries seasoned to your liking. Top it off with a perfect dill pickle... Heaven!
48,54,1,360,Very happy with the work Ray and his team has done on my '07 BMW 328i.  With over 116K miles on my car it's good to have a shop I am comfortable with.  My car and I like Scott's Motor Werks.
79,87,1,6282,The blizzard mini was just enough temptation to allow me to feel like I did get junk food without feeling like I ate junk food. Love the blizzards and they are worth the drive. Not a fan of the Julius anymore. It just wasn't the same as when we wow acid-washed jeans and hung out at the mall. I can't pinpoint what was wrong-perhaps the decade.....
49,57,1,8593,"Had a gyro, and is one of the best ones I've ever had. I'm from Chicago so I'm critical when it comes to gyros, beefs, pizza and hot dogs. Still have to try the other foods here though."
10,10,1,8122,Always a great source of Filipino food.
93,96,1,932,Awesome company. I called them and they had someone out within the hour. Their technician had excellent customer service. Very fast and reliable.  Talked to me very clearly and made sure I understood everything in detail. Made me feel very comfortable. He was very knowledgeable. Answered all my questions and had my A.C. running strong again in a couple hours. I would recommend these people to anyone looking for a reputable quality company to get the job done right.
111,117,1,3617,"Met friends on a Sunday evening. I was very surprised at the menu, like other reviewers, I expected just another tavern. BF had the T-bone, huge portion and he loved it! I had to leave after an appetizer, due to scheduling, but the party of 6 stayed for hours! Only thing missing, only one Cider option. Attention management: Apple ciders are all the rage, and a good option for ladies that don't care for beer. You get the gents in with all your beers, but keep us girls happy too!"
139,155,1,8174,"This store is awesome!  They have tons of clothes and accessories for your furbaby.  Their prices are great.  When I saw how cute everything was I thought for sure it would be super expensive but it wasn't at all.  They also offer grooming and boarding/doggy daycare.  The area they keep the dogs is really cute.  There is two areas, one for large dogs and one for small dogs.  They have tons of cushy beds and fun toys to keep your dog comfy.  They have special events from time to time, like adoption events and over the holidays they had a day where you could bring your pet in to get their picture taken with Santa.  Great local shop.  Check it out!"
54,59,1,5065,"What a nice place to spend time with someone special, especially at night.  We ran around the park like teenagers watching the moving illiminated lights as they changed color.  We stood under the railroad bridge as a train passed overhead.  A great place for a first kiss!"
94,102,1,6914,"Great cupcakes, pastries, baked goods, and breads.\n\nThe workers here are super nice and the shop is clean and cute.\n\nI wish I could have tried more stuff, but I only had the chance to try their cupcakes. They were moist and full of flavor. If you're looking for a sweet treat, make sure to come here. They are also on the outskirts of Uptown Charlotte, so parking is so much easier here."
57,61,1,5457,"After doing my Yelp research, I went to Europin to alter a dress for me.  I was completely satisfied with the alteration and really surprising impressed with their kindness and customer service.  Very very nice people.  I would absolutely go again for alteration needs that pop up in the future."
21,21,1,9228,Great pizza this one is better than the other one in Pasadena wish this one was in California.
77,84,1,8928,The best way to experience Vegas is with the jackify experience. I've done two invasion tours both during EDC week and if you know anything about EDC week in Vegas it's a mad house and a 100 dollar minimum to get in anywhere. With the jackify experience we did 5 pool party's and 5 clubs such a great time. Our host was tex and did a beyond great job
77,84,1,7025,"Ok gang, we just left this place & hurried our goody bag home. FINALLY! What more can I say? Chandler finally has a really good chinese restaurant. They cook your food to order in no time. More importantly...you can recognize the ingredients in your food & it taste great. This is where my gf & I will go when we're jonesing for chinese food."
62,67,1,4631,"I've never been to New York, but I've got to believe this is the closest thing to authentic NY pizza you're going to find this far south. Giant slices! If you're going for lunch, plan on take out. The place isn't very big and the seats fill up quickly!"
93,96,1,4415,"Love to go to Aj's Fine foods !  They have a great salad bar, and they always have a special sandwich of the week!  You can also have a burger grilled out on the patio, if it is a nice day, the patio is perfect to enjoy your lunch !  If you sign up on their e mail they will send you coupons, I just used one, for slice of cake, buy one, get one free,and they were delicious !"
70,73,1,3518,"I love this Fry's. It is so new and so clean. The lighting is great and the staff is amazing! They have the best deals by far, even without coupons. I've never had a problem with the food and the produce is always really fresh. I like that they carry a pretty good amount of the vegetarian brands too."
85,90,1,8776,This place has something for everyone.  My wife and I started going there out of convenience before attending a movie at the South Pointe.  But then we continued going back because we liked the food and the staff is very helpful.  This most recent visit I had sushi for the first time and it was very good - and reasonably priced.  We have company coming and are going to make it one of our stops on their visit.
40,43,1,9281,"Happy to have a Jersey Mikes in Surprise, AZ. Been here 4 times and the have never disappointed! This location is extremely busy   Yet, they are very good at working through the crowds."
136,147,1,8899,"While visiting Las Vegas we wanted to sample some off-the-strip excellent Asian food.  Was not disappointed. The Sea bass was incredible.  The spring rolls were delicious as well as the peanut sauce served with it.  The entire staff was extremely attentive to our every need and bent over backwards to make sure that the meal was as pleasant as possible.  This restaurant is a gem.  My only complaint not enough customers enjoying the food.  This restaurant has been open for six weeks.  This is a tough business.  Please give it a shot.  It deserves our support.\n\nBTW, the cost for the four of us was less than half of a meal on the strip."
142,150,1,6340,"I have heard great things about this place from a friend of mine. When I read the previous review I was a bit worried that they were closed. I drove by today and they are open for business. Not sure what happened, but the place was busy and I decided to check it out.\n\nThey serve breakfast and lunch, and everything is home-made. Instead of a sandwich I decided to have the hummus and chicken breast.\n\nThere was plenty of food, making it well worth the price. The chicken was freshly grilled, juicy and flavorful. The hummus was wonderful. It also came with pita bread. It was all just a little too much to eat, actually."
143,164,1,3662,"Nine inches is small? That's the sort of thing that makes me feel inadequate. \n\nI mean, must make other sandwich shops feel inadequate. How are any of these other joints supposed to compete when $7 will get you nine fantastic inches of OFFICIAL cheesesteak. $13 will get you 20 inches. That's a lot of sandwich.\n\nAnd the Capastrami ain't bad either. I have to admit that I've had better pastrami, but I lived three blocks from Katz's for years, so I'm spoiled. However, I do love the flavor combination.\n\nThe bread, the steak, the smiles, and the value here all justify the enormous wall of awards Capriotti's absolutely deserves."
25,29,1,1418,"Great food, great decor! Must go! 4.50 for breakfast croissant sandwich. So delicious and worth it..."
52,56,1,1791,"This place was very nice! The atmosphere was very happy and friendly! I recently visited the Golden Nugget on Fremont when I visited Vegas in Feb. 2014! For the first time ever! It was very nice clean, would definately go back again soon!"
57,61,1,9625,"Wow! Customer service lives. Manager even came by to check in on us after our wait was a little longer than expected. Great servers, ambience and food - original and savory. From the customer service to the quality of the food, I recommend you to check it out!"
133,151,1,3145,"I had brunch here with a friend a couple weeks ago. It was a great breakfast spot! I had the protein pancakes and some egg whites on the side! Soooo yummy! Our server was friendly and the manager came over and chatted a bit too. Nice place, old school coffee mugs that you almost wish had hot cocoa and marshmallows instead of coffee in 'em! My friend had one of the omelets with potatoes, needless to say she was busy eating rather than participating in the conversation! I'll definitely be back! Good choices for someone trying to stay on a healthier track... as long as you have the strength to choose accordingly! I'll definitely be back!"
46,53,1,4407,"Blue Wasabi is a favorite of ours. While it is a bit overpriced normally, their happy hour is stellar. We typically get the Badda Bing and a couple of avocado rolls. Great service, fun atmosphere, good restaurant!"
64,66,1,3921,"Jonathan does a wonderful job with my very curly hair. I have had two Brazilian Blowouts from him and I have completely enjoyed the results. My hair is now manageable, soft and the curls are loose, pretty and easy to care for. I have also received very nice color and highlights from Jonathan at Aspen Salon."
122,126,1,9581,"I recently had my hair done by Suzanne, and I couldn't be happier!! Most of my family and I have been going to her for 10+ years. She always does an amazing job for both men and women. I got my hair dyed this time. I sent her a picture of what I wanted ahead of time, and she went out her way to track down the perfect colors for the job. She really cares about her work and making sure it is perfect. Again, I couldn't be happier about my hair. So glad she's at a salon right around the corner from my house!"
55,59,1,4817,"I had a great time at this place... When i was there the dance floor wasnt too crowded and they played a great mix of old-school hip-hop & R&B! LOVED it. Although,  Im not sure if every night is like that there!"
113,122,1,1578,Dr. Sura and her staff are the best.  I have been taking my dog there for years.  The prices are reasonable and I can always get an appointment when I need one.  I do participate in the wellness plan because it is a good deal if you take your pet for regular health care.  It also saves you money if your pet requires prescription food.  Most of all Dr. Sura discovered a cancerous tumor in my dog and because of her quick action she made a quick recovery and is still cancer free one year later.  I highly recommend Family Pet Hospital.
44,48,1,2571,"Tryst is a mini version of XS but with the pool area replaces by a waterfall.\n\nCame on a Saturday night and the line wasn't too long. Beautiful club, great music. Highly recommended."
51,56,1,2627,I'll be back.  I can only give it 4 stars because we only had one item from here.  My review might change upon a revisit.  Awesome place to get some sugar in you and people watch for a little bit.  Had the mousse.
48,60,1,8450,"Se\u00f1or Taco 2 is amazing!  We come here for breakfast at least twice a month.  The staff is always friendly and atmosphere is casual.  The breakfast items are quality and a good value.  Try the chillaquilles, que bueno!"
115,129,1,1731,"We took the kids there and it wasn't bad.  Lots of locals and I hear lots of MILFs/Cougars on most nights.  It's a typical Burger/Bar.  Nothing remarkable, but not bad either.  If it were closer we would go more.  \n\nIt's just north a few miles of Desert Ridge, so if during the holidays Desert Ridge is packed and you're looking for decent food a few miles up the road, then stop by.  There are always coupons around in money mailer, Valupak, etc, - so I would look for some too."
47,52,1,1245,"Living downtown is expensive, but the staff is friendly, work with you and keep the place orderly\nGreat Views, great gym Capital Fitness\nPrices are going up everywhere but Butler Plaza is still less than many of the newer bldgs"
69,73,1,7567,"I like Subway all around, and this is a good location.  During lunch and dinner rushes the place can get really packed, so I generally try to avoid those times if possible.  Service is always fast and friendly.  Since there's so much traffic you know everything is rotated and fresh.  Pretty easy location to get in and out of."
238,255,1,7383,"First of all, I commend the owners for opening a restaurant next to both Raku and Monta, highly rated and well loved restaurants.  In a move I was almost ashamed to make steps from Monta, I got the beef ramen.  It was as good as I've had anywhere.  The broth was delicious and the slow cooked beef was tender and delicious.  It was the first time I had beef tendon and I was pleasantly surprised.  We also got the curry dish with pancakes and that was very good as well.  Most of the dishes are around $5 and are very generous portions.\n\nWe were there when they were not busy and the staff was super friendly and helpful to us picking out dishes.  We enjoyed everything we ordered and even discovered a delicious type of chili sauce that they have on the tables that I have since purchased and use at home.\n\nThere was not much fault in our experience, but I have to mention that it smelled pretty bad in the dining room the night we were there.  Not joking, the restrooms smelled better than the dining room.  My wife wanted to walk out right away the smell was so strong.  Get that figured out and I'll go back."
246,286,1,4140,"Chicken Latino is easily my favorite place to eat in the Strip and is one of my favorite places to dine in Pittsburgh. Their fried burritos are crunchy and gooey on the inside and, with a splash of their verde sauce, taste like heaven.\n\nTheir rotisserie chicken is seasoned well and goes well with their black beans and spanish rice.\n\nWhat really steals the show and is my undisputed favorite item on the meny is their carnitas. They're only served on the weekends but they're delicious. Fork tender and with a bit of fat for flavor, put a bit in your fresh tortilla with some rice and beans and a splash of verde for heat. What happens is what I suspect occurs right before you take your first breath; this otherworldly sense of peace.\n\nEveryone working there is great, too. They do a good job waiting tables in what I consider a casual eatery, not a place that you'd expect such good service.\n\nDefinitely try their horchata and tres leches cake, too. Yum.\n\nFor a longer review: http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2010/09/15/in-which-i-describe-my-love-of-green-salsa/"
20,26,1,5603,Lovely place. A must is their veggie haggis in a pastry parcel with lovely red onion gravy
126,142,1,1310,"A chic shopping center with a nice selection of restaurants, household wares, and clothing stores, just to name a few. Although the setup of the park means you'll be walking outside from store to store, it's shaded and scenic enough that you won't mind so much during the scorching summer months. A plus of this center is that they allow dogs around the shopping areas, although I haven't tried to take my dogs into any stores except the excellent Petique pet supply/adoption store. The addition of the Union area of the Biltmore caters to a younger crowd, housing such stores as Smeeks and the delicious Whoopie Baking Company."
53,57,1,8131,"Food was outrageous. Ed, our bar tender, was the most personable and knowledgeable bar tender I've ever had. Drinks were fabulous. Order off the menu or just chat with Ed and he'll make you something special. You must check out this scene!"
62,66,1,6839,"Classic delicious wings. Beer specials for happy hour. Friendly bartenders/waiters that sing to you and their coworkers, and FOOTBALL/any other sport you could imagine on their numerous big screens around the bar. I hope you have a ride home after your awesome sports outing, because you should stay a while!"
40,44,1,3284,"last honost burger chain america! besides dicks in seattle, double double is legit, fries are ok but at least they are fresh, this place gets packed so be prepared for a short wait."
67,75,1,4074,"All you need is LOVE!  I've been waiting to see this show since it came out.  It's always been too expensive so when we saw a deal online, we jumped on it!  The show was amazing!  They sell big drinks for $15.  I kept the cup!  I love the music...I love the beatles!"
81,84,1,7912,"Awesome company. We had them come seal the tile in our newly built home. They were early, friendly, meticulous, and even applied a third coat of sealer to high traffic areas. They consulted with my wife as to which cleaning products would work better than others, and were in and out in a short time. And they came in under budget too. Will use them again in a heartbeat."
75,89,1,4395,I've eaten at Sushi Samba before in NY and I'm a fan therefore I did not hesitate to eat here again for lunch when I was in Vegas.  The food did not disappoint.  Sushi rolls were fresh and yummy.  We had the kobe and lobster.  My choice of cocktail raspberry watermelon was refreshing.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable.  Pricey but definitely worth it.
132,146,1,119,"The portions are huge and the wait time is rather long.  It's always an annoying comfort when you have to wait a hour to get seated.  It means you've chosen the right place to eat and that seemingly everyone else in the city has chosen the same place.\n\nThe food isn't exactly unique, but the price is definitely a steal.  My Western omelette lasted me 3 consecutive meals.  Their hash brown mash must have an addictive additive mixed in with it's goodness because I can't seem to stop scooping those potatoes into my mouth.\n\nGo, my fellow Charlotteans!  It'll be worth the wait and kind to your wallets."
22,23,1,5375,"Wonderful box. Staff was great, class was a lot of fun, and members were really friendly!"
28,29,1,1741,The place is colsed. Locked up tighter than a drum. Word on the street is dispute with land lord and holding back rent.
75,81,1,3773,"Needed to change my oil today. I frequently go to this Jiffy Lube and I've always had a good experience. Today was no exception! I received great service from the moment I arrived. They were polite, fast, efficient, and I did not have to wait long.  I've never been disappointed with the service I've received.  I highly recommend this location."
159,178,1,6717,"I love this Caffe Nero tucked away at the back of Blackwell's bookshop. It's the perfect place to duck into after some book shopping to browse through your purchases and relax with a decent coffee.\nYou can access it either from the street or directly from the bookshop, so it's perfectly situated if it's raining outside.\n\nBecause it's not positioned right on the main street, it perhaps misses some of the passing traffic, but that's no bad thing as it means that it's usually quieter than the trendier Black Medicine coffee house the next block up. Not that I don't like Black Medicine - far from it - but I find Caffe Nero has a more relaxing atmosphere, maybe because of the proximity of all those books?\n\nFree Wi-Fi too!"
97,108,1,1078,Friend found this place for our yearly trip to Lake Mead.   We have rented from other local places and these guys are very nice and informal.  No long video to watch and we're not overly suspicious of us.  Skis were in good shape and ran well all weekend. They worked with us on return time.   Easy transaction.  I left $300 which I got back the same 3 hundred bills I left.   Chris and Joe are great and plan on using them on all our future trips.
78,85,1,1626,"Hands down my favorite place to eat in Tempe. Food is ALWAYS good. Service, always friendly and timely served. I love that they promote local artists and it helps the atmosphere feel cozy and downhome. I'm fully convinced I'll never find a better greek salad or garlic dip. Wow. Thinking about it makes me wish I were back at ASU. Two thumbs, way up!"
47,51,1,9392,Best damn BBQ in AZ! The brisket was awesome. The beef ribs was awesome! The pulled pork was awesome! The sausage was awesome! The sauces were awesome! Can't wait to go back and try the pork ribs!
33,36,1,9088,"Came here for breakfast and ti was wonderful, I enjoyed a mimosa and some incredible pear French toast.  Service was very good, I will definitely come here again"
56,61,1,568,This place is very trendy and the service is great. The staff is friendly and always ready  to recommend dishes. They do not sell alcohol but you can bring your own wine and they will serve it for you. A great spot for meeting friends. I love their pho....
31,36,1,7690,Big place in Tempe Marketplace. Lots of outdoor seating. Great for gourmet beer lovers. Didn't try the food but many folks were on dinner dates
114,133,1,3869,"Our flight was delayed flying out of the Las Vegas airport so we were stuck at the airport for almost three hours. I got quite hungry and made my rounds to all the food places to eat but nothing seemed appetizing...when I came to this PACKED place, this is where I wanted to eat-plus it was right next to our terminal C14..I ordered the nachos with carnitas and let me tell you, for a minute , I forgot I was at the airport...MYFOOD WAS SO YUMMY - Great service too , thanks Angelina !!! Great way to end our vacation :-)"
113,117,1,1713,"Coming here is so fun I mean how could it not be, it the drive in movies you always have the perfect seat, you can eat whatever you want, and it's okay to talk. Its like a cross between a movie theater and your living room. It can be romantic  date or a fun family outing where no one gets upset if the kids have input on the movie. The movie seats recline and there is never anyone in front of you to keep you from putting your feet up that what dashboards are for. Gotta love it the movies with privacy."
126,138,1,2688,"We stopped here on saturday after dinner to catch up with some friends.  This bar is a no bullshit irish pub, it's not trying to be something it isn't.  They have all the beers you would expect an irish pub to have.  A sizeable bar, and ample seating.  Live entertainment singing old favorites from irish bands and old irish folk songs.  The only issue I had was as the night went on we couldn't hear ourselves talk as the music got progressively louder, but I suppose that's our own fault for going to an irish pub and sitting 10 feet from the stage..\n\nNot a bad establishment."
80,85,1,1543,"I have to say that this location was far better in food and service than their DC Ranch location.  Which is too bad, as I live around the corner from that place.  I was very happy with the food this time, much better pizza and salad.  The service was polite and attentive.  We even sat outside on a hot day, and with the shade and misters, it was comfortable."
14,18,1,6871,Good Gyro's and incredibly fast for takeout .  Will be back
32,35,1,4271,"I love their food. Everything I've had there has been delicious!\nThe chicken tikka, chicken curry, and coconut curry shrimp are really good!"
78,82,1,9661,"Hands down a 5. Not crowded, awesome decor and GREAT service. Very much appreciated the 20% military discount. Excellent food. My beer was served in a ball mason type jar. Happy hour is from 2pm - 7pm. First thing I saw was the pledge of allegiance on the wall when I walked in and thought damn right, this is America and I'm ordering a steak!"
58,62,1,5873,Stopped at brickhouse while visiting Madison for the first time. There was a great selection of Wisconsin beers on tap. We ordered the catfish sandwhich which was delicious and also tried the pulled pork sandwich which was great too. Our server was friendly and helpful. Very pleased and would definitely recommend!
53,60,1,8109,"Stephanie was awesome! On time, professional, and friendly. My makeup lasted all day for my engagement pics and it was exactly how I wanted it. My fianc\u00e9 was even impressed. Excited to post some pictures once I get them from our photographer."
89,102,1,4522,"This was my 2nd time here. Raku is probably the best restaurant I've ever been to! It's so much better than anything on The Strip. Some favorites include the sea urchin cold dish, sashimi specials, and pork cheek and pork ear skewers. The specials board can be a bit spendy, but I've never been disappointed. Save room for dessert at Snowflake shavery in the same parking lot--the perfect ending to a perfect meal."
53,61,1,8334,"Cute, delicious and hidden little joint! I had the B.A.T. savory crepe and a strawberry shortcake, both on point! I want to go back soon to try more of their pastries!! I'm so happy they are close to home."
73,78,1,1730,I love this place it's just down the road from our house and it's a great place to hang out.  The food is ok but I love kicking back and enjoying the tropical setting.  they have been great to the little league kids and the adults have fun.  It's a great neighborhood bar that you alwyas feel safe in with or without the kids.
181,192,1,713,"I'm really pleased with the services that we got at this place.  My wife and I are on a specialized meal plan that requires that we weigh and measure all of the food we eat.  This kind of planning and prep makes it very difficult to eat out.  However, the folks in the deli here were very helpful and accommodating to our requests in this regard.\n\nThen, when we were in the checkout line, our clerk offers us bags of ice to keep our food cold on the way home.  This is far and away better service than the Whole Foods in San Mateo back in the Bay Area.  I even remarked to my wife that I wish they could just pick the whole building up and relocate this Whole Foods to the San Francisco area.  We'd come often for the great service.  Prices are higher here than at Safeway, etc., but you are definitely getting what you pay for."
223,239,1,346,"I have found the Garden of Eden , a place so wonderful that it inspires dreams, hopes and desires. When driving to Baker I began being fearful that once more I would be let down by a garden shop. So many times I have opened my heart to others but they have let me down. Some are out of state, some are too commercial and some really are about big business . But Baker isn't like that . From the time I pulled up I felt at home and loved.. the  old signage  giving me the vintage vibe, nice. Lots of space  and stuff to look at , a Potpourri of Pottage even. The variety of herbs and veggies alone were enough to make my heart purr. The  plants  were lined up neatly  in rows that screamed  we are cared for but not over watered and ignored.We are plants that won't get home and die from some  a mystery interloper who we brought into your garden . The grounds , employees , plants and set up all seem to express : We Too Love Gardens just Like You!\nI was so pleased to find my new partner in living green  , oh happy day ."
255,285,1,3535,"Great little family owned place.  A good portion of the client\u00e8le is actually Middle Eastern, so they've got to be doing something right.  The owner, Mike, is always around and very friendly, and usually hanging out in the market part of the building.  There's a hookah bar upstairs, but having an aversion to hookah, I've never ventured in.   The market is neat to look around in and a good place to go for some excellent fresh feta cheese or lamb.\n\nOn to the food.. it is fantastic and inexpensive.  You can get a falafel sandwich and fries for under $5, but that's about the cheapest meal on the menu.  The have a lunch buffet Monday - Friday from 11-3 for $10.  It's a very small buffet and at least half of it is cold food like salads and hummus.  About 75% of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating, but I always enjoy it.\n\nAs an added bonus, the last time I was there the guy who refilled my water was wearing one of those t-shirts with kittens on it.. their faces on the front, and their butts on the back.  I don't know if he was serious or not, but it was pretty amazing."
206,228,1,9422,"I selected Dose Moving based on reviews that I had read on Yelp.  After I read the reviews, I figured they would show up with Halos on based on the reviews.  They didn't show up with halos but they did have a cape on and hada large S on their chest.  To start, they showed up over 1 hour early!  That's right; early, not late.  Pat along with three other movers got to work right away.  My only concern was they had no truck but just a trailer towed by a pickup truck.  Our move from a 3000 square foot house to a 1664 square foot townhouse meant we left a lot behind but I felt far too much for them to fit in that trailer.  Not to worry!  They did a great job of packing and our move went on without a hitch.\n\nI knew nothing about Dose Moving before I caled them but I now know them well enough to recommend them for your move.  Hard-working, courteous and efficient, I don't think you would be disappointed."
53,58,1,6821,"This is my second time here, and the Pho is good, and it was under $20 for two of us to have huge bowls of pho.  It was really clean, well lit, and the service was very quick.  In and out within 35 minutes."
102,107,1,7971,"James was the first employee I encountered and he was polite, respectful, helpful and sympathetic to the cost of my brake job.  With all that had to be done, the bill was to be over $900.00.  I wasn't happy and this being my first visit, I did not plan on returning.  James went to his manager and they reduced my bill by 23%.  I still feel their prices are high, but I walked out of there a satisfied customer and plan on returning when the need arises."
34,36,1,3528,"Awesome atmosphere!!! Great looking crew, and always an upbeat feeling! The front desk ladies always make this place even better, who would of thought that was possible!"
123,133,1,4972,"I had the green curry chicken with rice.  Very yummy.  Portions were large enough to take some home.  We went late for lunch but early for dinner so it wasn't busy.  The veggies were  very fresh and you can order things as spicy as you like.  I like it pretty hot but not ridiculous so I ordered a 4 out of 5 and it got my attention but didn't burn my buds.  It was perfect for me, but if you think Taco Bell has spicy food you better order a 1.\n\nI will go back again, they have many more dishes I would like to try."
53,56,1,3295,"Wouldn't have thought to go in here for sushi, but on the recommendation of several friends we tried it, and the food is fantastic.  Also, I personally find the small and slightly unfinished dining area welcoming, and for a Sushi place, very unique."
30,31,1,8825,For what it is and what it costs this place is perfect! Can definitely find some better sushi places but I would still come here again.
100,106,1,2453,"The waiter we had was terrible, for a high class steak house I was very surprised, he mumbled the whole time and we couldn't hear anything he said. The apps are pricey but the tomatoes were amazing and apps and sides are big enough to share. Each member of our party had a different steak and we all thought it was amazing. My medium-rare filet was cooked perfectly and incredibly smooth. I found it to be a bit overpriced but at least good food. Decor was beautiful."
145,159,1,4353,"I thought that I had caught the end of happy Hour as I entered about 6:30pm, but I was wrong. Cadillac ranch has Happy Hour all night on Monday, so it was 1/2 price drinks and appetizers for as long as you stayed. Being a huge soft pretzel fan, that's where my money went tonight. Originally $8.99, these are really, really good, but probably not for full price. Two huge hot pretzels and a very unique dipping sauce which was a vat of cream cheese fondue. It was a dreamy combination. They also have a huge projector screen TV in the middle of bar and an outdoor and indoor bar. Nice place for happy hour and football, especially on Monday's."
47,52,1,1498,"I have been a customer since 1995 and I cannot imagine going to any other auto repair shop in the Valley!  The mechanics have kept three of my vehicles running.  Honest, professional, friendly.   That's Whitey's to me."
115,121,1,3544,"I am glad to have found this place. I am not one who writes reviews but this is one that I must.\nIf you are looking for an alternative to avoid drugs with lots of side effects, try this Chinese doctor and his herbs.\nI had stomach pain on and off for three months now and finally something told me to go check this place.\nThe first night I took the concoction I felt a relief and soothing and calming effect.\nYou have to let him know if you are taking any medication though so he knows what to prescribe and advise."
26,27,1,8239,Go there! You will love it! Only been open a few months and it was packed at 10am on a Tuesday!
24,25,1,8620,"Great atmosphere, food, and craft beer selection. Comfortable seating inside and out with some great staff as well."
344,389,1,5290,"We tried The Turf for breakfast this weekend.  We were definitely not in the mood to wait a lifetime for Matt's after perusing the market, so we decided to head over to the Turf.  As expected, the place was empty except for one guy at the bar... considering it was like 9 am I am really hoping this guy was just drinking apple juice.  Our server was very nice, and I am pretty sure we had her on our first night here.  After explaining to us what black and white pudding was, ewww, and then running away, she came back for our breakfast order.  I got the Bacon and Cheese Omelet and the husband got Biscuits and Gravy.  My breakfast was served with hashbrowns and toast.  The hashbrowns were thin and crispy, just the way I like it.  My omelet was stuffed to the max with bacon and oozing melty cheese.  It wasn't a big fluffy omelet like at IHOP but it was a dense solid little guy.  I much prefer my omelets to be like this.  The husband was a little less than pleased with his meal.  We both agreed the gravy was pretty good and we really liked that there was actually sausage in it, the way it should be.  The disappointment was definitely in the biscuits though.  They were certainly not fresh and definitely not homemade.  Considering how easy and quick biscuits are to make, this bummed me out.  To the owner of Turf:  If you want me to, I will be more than happy to come over and show you how to make a good biscuit.  If there are good, fresh biscuits, this could be a great dish.  Not the best for breakfast, but a good alternative for when we don't feel like waiting for hours in the hot morning sun."
29,29,1,8570,Place was awesome this past Friday night! Our party of six had a great time and would go again every time we go to Vegas!
61,66,1,9014,"Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers is always delicious the times I've been here. It can be really busy, especially when a game is on. They host watch parties for several different teams. I prefer a weekday night just to avoid the big crowd; however, Cb&C has a really fun atmosphere!"
46,52,1,4329,"Good and fast...  Plus affordable, but I can only there once a week. I like this place because it is healthy and hearty :)  There are several locations and now they serve brown rice.  Therefore, good for me !!!"
24,27,1,4296,"The food choice we picked were awesome. Caterpillar Roll, Kano Salad, tuna roll. Very very kind people!"
25,31,1,5318,"Friendly staff, Awesome Poke! each bite took me back home to Hawaii! BEST POKE IN VEGAS! HANDS DOWN!"
70,74,1,416,"This is our regular breakfast spot, food and service are good and consistent.\nWe usually get coupons in the mail.\n\nThey get 5 starts for their crispy bacon, it is awesome.\n\nOne of my favorites is the chicken fried steak for breakfast, and the King Kong for dinner. They have good sandwiches too."
74,80,1,9579,"They deserve the 5 stars for making their margaritas with fresh lime juice. This makes the drink superb. Most places use mix and it ruins the margaritas. We also tried their salsas which were really good. They have fresh made chips, also a must for Mexican. They are open until midnight during the week, which makes this a great place to end the night."
232,254,1,921,"I got rooms for my family in the TOWER ROOMS.  They were TOTALLY updated from top to bottom with brand new furniture, new carpet, new big-screen TVs, granite counters in the bathrooms, tile shower, new towels & new linens, and were clean!\nThe curtains were floor to ceiling, and were black-out.  \nThe view from our rooms were of the pool & an unobstructed view of the city - spectacular.\nOur rooms were on a non-smoking floor, which they are strict about ensuring stay that way - hugely appreciated!  When someone was smoking in the hall, the security came right up to investigate.\nSecurity checks guest's IDs before allowing them up the elevators for safety purposes.  There was a Starbucks and a few restaurants, all connected to the casino.  The bummer was that you can smell the cigarette smoke in ALL of them.\nOur locked car was broken into, things were stolen right out of the hotel parking garage, but not enough security to catch the thief.  :(\nBesides that, the prices were fine, though the room rates end up being double after you pay for the per room/per day resort tax."
17,18,1,2045,Very nice store and clean.  Fast service & the manager Maria very friendly.
46,52,1,96,I enjoyed a 3 course brunch at Mimosa. We had a good discussion with our waiter about the area and the meal. Nice ambiance and food was top notch. I look forward to trying lunch/dinner in the future.
187,210,1,7024,"This place is so GOOD! I have been here twice and was satisfied with both experiences. I have tried the Rising Sun and Nom Nom burger. I'd recommend trying the Rising Sun because who can resist kobe beef, crispy yam, and avocado tempura all in one burger amongst some other stuff??? The crunchy texture just adds a whole new dimension to the burger. I eat a good amount of food and the burgers here are pretty filling. You also HAVE to try one of their milkshakes, whether it be a plain non-alcoholic one or the cool looking adult ones with alcohol haha. I have only tried the strawberry milkshake and it was so good and creamy without feeling too excessive. I usually don't like getting milkshakes, but this is one of the FEW places I am willing to get them. I will definitely go here the next time I am craving a burger on the strip and will probably try another milkshake. Check this place out!"
110,114,1,8894,"I had an ongoing issue in my home and I had Pure come out. The plumber and I discussed solutions and then he got a 2nd opinion from management so that the actions they would take would have the best possible outcome. The next day Joe showed up, found the problem and worked hard to fix in the most cost effective manner.  I got at least two followup calls and a note to make sure that I was completely satisfied with their work. Great customer service and their work solved my problem. I will definitely recommend to friends and use again."
39,46,1,263,The Mexican pizza add beef and cream cheese is to die for!  Their fried ice cream is the best ever.  The chili relleno is very flavorful and delicious.   My favorite Mexican food  restaurant!
19,23,1,4960,Second visit here. Excellent food. Seabass is amazing.  Salads are delicious and fresh.
42,43,1,7514,"Good selection of tasty beers.  I have eaten there a couple of times and we were seated quickly, served quickly, and enjoyed the the experience. Give it a try I think you will like it."
93,96,1,7708,"Slate interiors is like a pandora a box, you never know what you are going to find new and different. A lot my favorite things in my house are from slate. I will say that sometimes the parking can be a little tricky with the other businesses nearby compromising a lot of the parking, but if you get there at the right times, it's okay. Slate can also be good for smaller things like gifts, too. Keep up the good work!"
47,51,1,970,Super low key area. You'd never know this place was here unless you were actively searching for it yourself. I had the vanilla custard in a cone. So creamy and sweet = exactly what you need in the LV of summer
11,16,1,3418,What can I say!? It's Starbucks....
172,187,1,590,"I had always sworn off chiropractors. I think it was the popping sounds that make me nervous. I decided to go to Cottingham, who was recommended by a coworker, as a way to lure in my fiance who was in constant pain. I gave Cottingham 4 stars as this is my first experience and I really had nothing to compare it to. But I do think Jeff is a 5 star guy. On your first visit he will do an exam and take xrays. On your second return he will go over the xrays and plan of care. Being in the medical field, I think Jeff is very good about explanations and helping you understand things visually and physically. His knowledge comes across and made me feel more comfortable with the whole process. I didn't feel he was trying to push me into any unnecessary treatment plan. I'm just sorry I waited so long."
168,176,1,8956,"Just got back from a massage and decided to let everybody know what a great massage therapist we have in town. Located right by Freedom Park it is very convenient for me. The inside is very relaxing and calm. There is an acupuncturist in the house, so maybe next time i will schedule a session with him too. Ok now about a massage, since that's what counts more then anything, right?\nI came because my neck was hurting and Olena did a great job, she did go deep and found where the problem was, not like some therapist that just touch your skin. She gave me a full body massage i think i fell asleep somewhere in the middle of it melting into the soft table. Now i feel fabulous, neck feels better, and my body is like new. Cant wait to go back.  Give her try."
15,17,1,1833,Thank goodness for this restaurant. Above average mexican food and spectacular salsa
35,41,1,9187,"Convenient place for quality pasta.  I had a custom order of whole wheat penne pasta, with marinas sauce, shrimp, roasted garlic and tomatoes.  Good weight watchers meal."
88,94,1,6311,"I enjoy when the process is done right, everything just tastes better. And pita shack does it right. By only using fresh ingredients and meats. I had the chicken shawerma with Greek fries. The chicken was tender because they actually marinate the chicken for at least 2 hours. And the fries were golden with a perfect crunch and softness on the inside. I felt at home because of the great hospitality. I recommend this place to anyone."
69,85,1,7810,"I was recommended to come here by Dre at Montelucia resort and am I happy I did.\n\nThe guac with cranberries was weird at first, then delicious! I really enjoyed the barrio pollo and pescado tacos; best chicken taco ever hands down.\n\nThe service was hands down the best- props to Nomas and Ivette!!"
44,55,1,9532,"Unbelievable. Popovers are amazing! Even if you hate brussel sprouts, I dare you to order them! They are incredibly sweet and savory! I had the lamb, smaller portion than the filet mignon but so delicious!"
120,135,1,7318,"Stopped in here for lunch with my mom after visiting the Museum.  I was curious to try this place since it received a good review from Howard Seftel in the AZ Republic.\n\nIt's basically cafeteria style and you can order several interesting choices.  I noticed that a lot of their produce is organic and grown locally.\n\nI had the Global which if memory serves me correctly, was a braised beef shank.  It was served with a salad of super fresh ingredients including purple beets.\n\nDefinitely try to stop in for lunch.  They are only open 11AM to 2 PM."
114,122,1,2948,"O.M.G. portions were huge!!! Felt like I was eating in a buffet since the size of my plates were doubled. It was definitely a great experience and well worth your money. I ordered a sandwich with some seasoned potatoes and veggies. That thing was so big that I had to cut it into fourths. My friend also ordered a burger that she couldn't even scarf it down because it was that big. Overall, a great place to visit if you're hungry for some good appetite. Just remember that there will be leftovers on your way out."
46,48,1,3933,My favorite local theater to hang out at.  Buy the cup and t-shirt and you save on soda and popcorn and the shirt pays for itself if you see movies like we do.  We are here almost every week.
42,45,1,4896,The people are so helpful and friendly. Tonopah Rob really enjoys what he does. He is always happy to share ideas on how to prepare the vegetables. But he seems to cater to more then mores.
14,14,1,6247,Their Italian turkey sub is great. Service fast and friendly.
85,89,1,5715,"I'm a huge fan of this Starbucks. It's an easy shot off I-77 and the staff goes out of their way to get to know you and your drink. I know that's the Starbucks wat, but I get the feeling they actually like working there. It's right in the beginning of Baxter Village so you can sit down at the outdoor seating old wonder around town through the shops and little park."
6,6,1,2328,Absolutely gorgeous place.
139,159,1,2586,"Raucous, loud, rock-n-roll watering hole: fuck yeah!\n\nMy exact recollection of my experience here is somewhat hazy; mostly all I can remember is having a blast.  I wound up at Hogs & Heifers with a fairly big group doing a downtown pub crawl.  It was kind of a relief to find a dark, dingy cave of a bar after all the lights and 'showiness' of the casinos.  \n\nThe place wasn't too crowded when we arrived, and there was some kick-ass music blasting out of a robust sound system.  I'm not usually one for dancing (in public, anyway)... well, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, right? :)"
61,66,1,9573,Loved the ambience. The boba was ok I only wished that the milk tea was boiled instead of powder. Didn't get to taste the dessert but looked so amazing and the snow ice looks fantastic ! The workers were very pleasant and very wiling to accommodate me and customized the sweetness of my milk tea.
62,76,1,8686,"Fantastic hole in the wall. Cozy ambiance and delicious food. Their fish tacos are amazing, burgers juicy, deviled eggs nicely presented, and pretzel bun are soft. Sausages with curry ketchup and cheese dip was tasty too. The waffles fries is also another fave. All in all, great first time experience."
49,49,1,764,"This place is a gem. The Butter Bars are the best ever, not too rich so it makes your stomach ill, but perfect taste and 10 miles after i left wished i would have gotten more. Chocolate filled was best ever too."
109,120,1,7778,"This place was good, I will have to go back and try more menu items.  I kept it simple and got the bbq pork and chicken wrap with loaded mash and sweet tea.  Everything was good I think the wrap could have used more sauce however I did add bbq myself and that was good as well.  The sweet tea was good and the loaded mash was pretty good even with a little bbq sauce on it.  I want to try the ribs and more will definitely come back.  More of a quick eat or take out kind of place."
51,62,1,8834,"Tom was amazing.  \nWorth every penny of my $20/hrs + $10 tip.  I went in with a aching head, neck, back, legs and foot.  After an hour with Tom, I come out feeling relaxed without any ache and pain."
37,42,1,8452,This is burger done right. Did the Burner burger. Actually spicy and the Ghostbuster sauce was hot too. GF did the Rattlecan and loved that one too. Come get some.
8,8,1,7396,nice store real busy real friendly
17,20,1,1558,I wrote my elaborate review under Sanctuary Spa.  This place is near PERFECT.
112,116,1,1509,"My wife and I are new to the valley and originally from New York. we went here for a Saturday night dinner to celebrate our anniversary, and boy we were surprised with the service & food. yes, for Chinese food it's a bit pricey. but the menu is wide, the  quality is great, everything was tasty and we really enjoyed the service. on top of that they gifted us for a first time visit and/or anniversary, not sure why for which of the one, but it doesn't matter. we will definitely come here again."
27,33,1,8918,Amazing gourmet tacos at non-gourmet price. Great patio and service. Beer selection limited but cool breweries. Definitely coming back.
39,41,1,7281,"I've eaten here three times and had an excellent experience each visit! Great food, nice staff. It's the perfect place to take an out-of-town guest to eat!"
290,310,1,5344,"If you want a nice break from the strip, then definitely stay here! All their rooms are so nice and spacious! It's really quite compare to the strip, which is super nice and just what I needed. I stayed over the summer and their pool is amazing! There's little cabana beds in the water, which is nice to sun bathe. \n\nI went gambling downstairs and brought my bottle of wine with me, no one said anything for the longest time, so I thought it was fine. When I was down to my last quarter of the bottle a lady comes up and says \""""miss, you're not allowed to be drinking from a bottle\"""" I laughed out of awkwardness and didn't know what to do. Did she expect me to throw it away? So I kindly said okay I'll go back to the room, but she nicely said just go to the bar and ask for a glass. And that is what I did. So just letting you all know...drinking from the bottle is a no no.\n\nMy favorite part of this hotel would be the wine tasting place. Definitely order the cheese plate!\n\nThey used to have hash house, but I don't believe it's there anymore, which I find disappointing because it was so good! You'll have to head to the strip for that. \n\nThe M buffet is also one of my favorites! I love their breakfast buffet."
50,55,1,4921,Love the desert heat wings. Lots of TV's for your sports viewing. The service is generally good the last couple times we have had to return the queso dip as it came to the table lukewarm. Each time the server was very apologetic.
50,55,1,799,"First of all BIG shoutout to Joseph.  He is my man.  I love their food.  You can't go wrong with a number one combo, or a GCC, or both.  I have never received bad service there, they are GREAT!"
34,36,1,7962,We have been here twice. The office is clean and the staff is very courteous. Both doctors were very nice. Much better experience than the typical urgent care.
84,86,1,8910,So I work pretty close to this place and I stop in here at least once a week to get a quick bite. Ive stuck to the happy side of the menu and I have been pretty happy every time I eat there. The portions are filling and the people that work there are kind and upbeat. This place has a nice vibe to it and certainly deserves a visit if you're in the area for lunch.
31,37,1,6810,"We've been going for years -- I'm obsessed with Thai curries -- of the dozens of places we've tried, this is always our favorite!"
8,8,1,6547,Great food at affordable prices.
61,64,1,9631,"Kiko styled my hair for a photo shoot and my wedding! He is amazing and I wouldn't trust anyone else but him with my hair for a special day. I have also had him trim my hair. He is the sweetest person, professional and filled with talent! Love love love his style!"
8,8,1,7815,"Nice office, nice staff!"
35,38,1,7728,Best pizza in Vegas.  It smells like an East Coast Italian restaurant!!  I will be back to try other items on the menu.  Had to get the pizza again!
57,60,1,7594,"This is my favorite cold brew iced coffee around. I'm not a coffee expert but based on the Cold Brew that I have had around Scottsdale, this wins. I get my 64 oz jug filled up every Sunday and it lasts me the week. Staff is nice as well."
75,87,1,8349,"I always sit at the bar.  Kim or Pam, not sure about name, she's so great.  Good recommendations.  Love the short rib taco platter.  Comes with corn tortilla, guacamole, salsa.  The ahi taco is good too. But my soul food go to is the short rib.  So glad they opened a branch at the airport. Food comes out fast!"
91,97,1,5937,"I used Eli to renovate our condo that was built in 1950. Although we tried to keep as much of the charm as possible, we had to replace the doors and jambs, bathroom tile, vanities and baseboards.  Eli was able to get the work done quickly and for a fair price. He was also great to be around and his van is the coolest! As an interior designer, I've also recommended him to my clients. Thanks, Eli!"
29,30,1,5821,"The location does not do this restaurant any justice, right next door to a plan parenthood. Food is excellent, best Asian food around."
63,67,1,7395,I like this place.  I have been to the location on west Sahara several times.  I just went to the north Rainbow location and it was actually better than the Sahara location!  The only thing that would earn more stars would be the inconsistent service.  Sometimes it is great and other times it is just ok.
54,59,1,6388,Easy walking access from strip or fashion show mall. Have dined here twice. Both times enjoyed the chicken tacos. Authentic fresh corn tortillas. Fresh chicken. Good flavor. Typical Vegas prices. I suggest spending $3 and getting the endless chips and salsa- worth it.
245,268,1,8878,"It's funny, I've lived in the neighborhood for more than a year, but I didn't stop in for a meal until now. After having the chef special Panang with Fish, I wish I had stopped in much sooner! It was served fairly quickly, with a medium spiciness as I'd ordered it. The peanuty curry sauce was delicious and creamy! The ambience was quiet and calm with soothing soft music, a nice escape from the light rail construction. I like that you can eat in groups, as a couple, or solo with their IHOP-style booths (it looks like an old IHOP inside, and there were a couple of leftover IHOP logos on their window coverings). There were plenty of chef specials to choose from; I hope to try the chef's Crisp Basil Tofu another time. There was a TV for viewing in one corner of the restaurant. It seems very family-friendly, with high chairs and booster seats for the kiddos. They've even got a few toys on hand in case the kids need them for a bit. :) Bathroom was clean with a baby changing station in it. The service was great, friendly and fast. I'm definitely coming back to try other Thai favorites, like their Green Curry!"
52,53,1,7254,I brought my cat here having trouble finding someone to work with my schedule and Helen went out of her way to do my cat and she did a wonderful job and now I take my doggie here to love this place they are really nice and great customer service
21,21,1,2199,food is spicy and has loads of flavor will come back again and try the other items as well
76,82,1,7874,The Corner has implimented some new offerings on it's already successful salad bar. The addition of hot food items is very welcome. Our favorite is the mac and cheese! The staff is friendly and helpful. The management is always present to insure good quality food and service. This restaurant is an excellent addition to Cityscape in downtown. The Corner is full of surprises well worth exploring.
85,90,1,2678,"100% love this place. I've been three times, all when passing through Phoenix, and I will be surely sorry if this place ever changes. I appreciate their choice to use fresh, wholesome ingredients, and their food is delicious. Amazing hash browns, fresh juice, homemade preserves, great bread! Everything is tops. The only bummer is that it's always packed, but I don't hold that against them."
348,391,1,9384,"I stopped by here late last night for a late snack with my fianc\u00e9 and another couple. We arrived a minute before 10 and saw a worker turning off the open light.  While we offered to leave he told us we would be their last customers and it was not a problem.  This kindness was shown again and again throughout the 30 or so minutes that I was there and I honestly felt the staff was super kind and inviting.  As for the inside of the restaurant it looked like, well, a pizza shop.  A small counter to order from, lots of booths and an area to wait.  There was also some cool instrumental music of current pop songs playing in the background which I thought was awesome.\n\nFor my pizza cones I went with both a pepperoni cone and mafia cone while my fianc\u00e9 went with the meditteranean cone and a dessert Nutella cone.  Honestly I wasn't quite sure what to make of the cones whenever they got to the table.  They were somewhat thick and clearly made of a pizza like dough.  However they proved to be perfect at keeping everything in the cone while not overwhelming the toppings. Overall the inside tasted like a good pizza with copious amounts of all the right toppings.  My fianc\u00e9s Nutella cone was made of a crepe like cone and topped with with whipped cream.  While this cone was a bit more fragile and thereby messy, my fianc\u00e9 loved the cone and Nutella pairing.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While it's not going to replace the traditional pizza places for me I still think it's worth a stop.  The novelty of a pizza cone combined with the friendliness of the staff made this a great stop for us."
194,205,1,9118,"I was at Dolce two times this weekend. First for my birthday I got an all over color and cut by Jessica and she did an amazing job. She knew exactly what color would work for me and she definitely delivered. I was also there today for an updo for my engagement photos today and I can't remember the girl's name- Sara maybe, but she did such a good job replicating the picture I showed her. It was a half up half down with volume and curls. Although I had an appointment in the morning my curls lasted the entire day! While I was getting my eye make up done at MAC I had 2 people compliment my hair as well. This is a complete 180 from the experience I had at the Scottsdale Quarter Drybar for my first round of engagement photos. They completely messed up my hair so I am extremely grateful for my awesome experience at Dolce. Thanks ladies!!! My birthday hair looked awesome and I'm sure my engagement pictures came out beautiful!"
121,127,1,3334,"So, the prices are a little higher on most items in the store. The trade-off is that you can ask anyone who works here where to find something, and they will walk with you to the item's location. They'll also ask if they can help you look up some obscure part number for your sprinkler system. The girls working the registers are always friendly and helpful, too.\n\nIf you need a key made or some paint matched or something for your yard or a tool, Ace is so much more convenient and well organized than warehouse stores are and the service just wins."
72,83,1,2251,Last meal in Vegas before flying home. Fabulous food and outstanding service. The goat cheese fundido was scrumptious as an appetizer. I had grilled mahi mahi which was very flavorful and had a spicy twist. I love spicy so it was right up my alley. Wife had smoked shrimp tacos which were excellent as well. If in Vegas this is a must meal!
200,238,1,7018,"I had the most deee-licious burger here the other day.  I split a Fun-ghi burger with my friend and shared buffalo wings.  We knew the burger would be awesome just from it's aroma, but man, when I took my first bite, I was in burger heaven.  From the menu description, the Fun-ghi burger contains: Beef Patty, Truffle Marinated Portabella Mushroom, Carmelized Onion, Gruyere, Mayonnaise, & Frisee.  We also added avocado to ours and ordered the patty to be cooked medium rare.  The burger was juicy and had an abundance of flavors from all the ingredients.  The buffalo wings were very good too.  The fries were standard.  I so want to come back and try the Billionaire Burger and a shake!  The Billionaire Burger has kobe beef and foie gras, which we can't have anymore in CA.\n\n\nAs Seen on TV:\n\nUnique Eats\nAired on 07/22/2012\nEpisode: Las Vegas\nOver the top desserts."
279,337,1,5018,"i came here for dinner the other day while in town and although i had a great dinner here...the only thing that really stood out was the dessert i had....its the only thing that im writing the review on.\n\nsat down at the bar for a bite and to watch the world series game...had some drinks. had tacos. wanted something sweet...so i ordered dessert.\n\nFML.

103,118,1,6757,"my favorite indulgence.  The concretes are delicious.  Love the options and toppings. (although it can get slightly pricey when adding all of the toppings) Every employee I have seen has been very nice.  The other day I went through the drive through with my dog.  The employee working was so nice and chit chatted with me about dogs and then brought out a small doggie sized cone and asked if he could have it.  I really appreciate these little things that bring a smile to my face,  It keeps us coming back!"
99,102,1,5112,I went there for my first massage ever recently. I had Tyler and he was wonderful. I was having bad pain in my lower back and I have not had any pain since my visit. It was an overall peaceful and pleasant experience. I left feeling so relaxed and I will be visiting again sometime soon.  Unlike some of the others comments I luckily did not get hassled about getting the membership. They asked me if I would be interested in it and when I said no they moved on.
81,87,1,321,"The staff here is great very friendly and always greeted with a hi & smile! I get my brows done by Jessica she is the master of brows! The salon is clean and professional,Wait time is good not too long.They carry a variety of hair products from Paul Mitchell,Redken,Matrix,TIGI,etc. Go In and see them for a great hair cut,color and waxing!!!!"
54,56,1,2098,"I have never been disappointed and have only had great success in introducing others to the restaurant. If you are visiting from elsewhere, this is an opportunity to leave the usual Las Vegas hustle and bustle. If you live in Las Vegas - you probably already eat here!"
64,70,1,4028,"This place is pretty good.  Convenient and great hours.  Although I greatly prefer rice over a sandwich 95% of the time, this place was pretty good.  Nice location at the edge of the PH Casino and shops.  The food came out very fast and fresh.  Great place for a quick bite with reasonable prices."
19,21,1,9285,"My favorite pizza! Always get greeted with a smile.   Fresh ingredients, great flavor."
91,96,1,7169,"This is a roadtrip type of place for sure.  Met the owners at a different place and they seemed nice so decided to check it out. Pretty good selection of beer, not as good as taste of tops or papago but better than 98% of the other bars out there.  Didn't try the food, just there for beer. Service was so so.  Wish the owners had been there and if they are when you visit give them a shout."
43,48,1,1718,"They've printed business cards, rack cards, and even banners for me.  All perfect.  I used to try and use the cheapo online shops, but that was a waste of my time. Zymages rocks."
77,81,1,4139,"This place is LEGIT! Best pizza I've had in years. The people are friendly and the price is average for great pizza. Every time I go in, I end up chatting with the staff for a few minutes and they always remember me and my order. I guess that's not a good sign of my health LOL but it is a good sign of great customer service!"
46,58,1,3,Good quality pork fried dumpling and mongo beef.  Bar service was fast and Efficent.   Good value.  Not a 5 cause dragon eye tea was cold first time around and beef had minor amount of fat.   Fortune was even Postive!
32,37,1,3582,Best Mexican food in town.  Small cafe type restaurant so there is no BS just great food and at a fraction of the price at Ricardos or Macayos.
63,81,1,1020,"Sam's Town for a week, comp food so...but Billy Bob's lamb was off the hook, perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned, soft, no smell, no off taste, so good..other steaks were ok...pimpkin cheesecake was really good...definite repeat..service is great and not iverly attentive."
67,74,1,5927,This is a high end Chinese restaurant that has great service and very good food.  Be prepared to pay a premium price for rather small portions.  You might need to order 2 dishes per person if you are at all hungry.  The food is really good with high end ingredients.  The mongolian beef was spectacular....I would recommend it.
94,111,1,7016,"Their alcohol selection sucks, as in they ran out of everything they said they had.  I had to have a Sapphire tonic...SAPPHIRE, PEOPLE!!!  \nThe waiter said she had Hendricks and then dreamcrushed my cocktail dreams.\nMy other friend wanted a beer and 8 of the beers he wanted they were \""""out of\"""".\nHowever, the burger was nice, very juicy and rare.  \n\nPlus, the more you drink the better everything tastes, right?"
76,81,1,9114,Henry provided on-site legal counsel at a very reasonable price. I was very impressed by his professionalism and preparedness.  I felt Henry was more than just a lawyer--he was a trusted partner when it came to handling my difficult case. I was extremely satisfied with his services and would highly recommend Henry and Lawtruck.com to anyone in need of a caring and experienced lawyer!
29,33,1,5460,Very unique and quite delicious food! We have tried several different entrees and they all are fantastic! Crab Rangoon's are a must here!
37,42,1,958,"One vegan choice after another. Ronald, I love you. I had a delicious and enormous apple fritter. We filled a big box to go. I'm one happy vegan!"
45,46,1,4984,Also went here today. Anybody who is interested in history or history of toys may want to pay a visit here.I quite enjoyed just a little nit more than the peoples story. Every picture here told a story.
10,10,1,2516,Everything you could want from a buffet!
57,61,1,1479,"What a gem of a place in old town Scottsdale. Has it all from ambiance to service. They use as many local products as possible, great bruch sparkling wine selections. Prices are great and portions spot on. This place is must try, I will be going there again!"
25,27,1,9149,I've been using Maidly since they launched and have been happy with their service. Booking is a piece of cake!
8,12,1,6752,Delicious calzones and meatball subs!
30,33,1,1568,"I love the Hummus from here! I do not like their food. I go quite often but,  to only eat the Hummus! Delicious!"
33,38,1,8179,The good is great johnny is awesome.  My favorite is duck salad. All the food is goid there is a new bsr staff that makes sll the difference.
60,77,1,3826,"Loved this place we had the stuffed calamari which tasted awesome, hubby doesn't like calamari but he sure liked it here.....we had the pineapple curry with shrimp, it was so so delicious and the seafood combination can't complain....will definitely be going back...even the iced tea tasted great!"
51,55,1,2614,"Food was authentic and yummy, although a bit cold.  Not sure if it sat too long in the window, but the huge shrimp would have been excellent-had they been hot.  Service was fantastic!  Will be going back for hopefully hot food!"
81,90,1,7082,"Hottest club in Las Vegas now. I love the DJ's and the energy that's there. You have the option to be inside or outside. It's wonderful! Guys beware if you're going without girls be prepared to pay a premium or go super early.\n\nHint, if you're staying at Cosmo you get a different line to get in and it's a little bit cheaper."
143,157,1,4877,"You'll give this place 5 stars also if you go in with the right expectations. \n\nIs the food the best Chinese I've ever had? Probably not, but it's definitely better than average. Here's how I put it to a friend: Their food is somewhere between Panda Express and a higher end Chinese joint,  BUT a better value by far then either of those. \n\nThe food is clean, the service is fast and best of all, you won't find many better \""""bangs for your buck\"""". We recently fed a family of 6 for 43 dollars and I was eating leftovers for lunch for three days. Love it! Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."
146,156,1,4936,"I'm very glad this Super Target is so close to my house. It is a great store for just about anything. It's very big, well stocked, and clean. The grocery is pretty awesome. I usually buy my groceries right down the street at Fry's Marketplace but it's nice to be able to stop here on the way home to pick up any last second items for meal planning.\n\nThe staff is always friendly and helpful. Sometimes it's hard to find somebody on the floor if you have questions or need to find something.\n\nI don't drink coffee but there's a Starbucks here also. It's a nice sit in coffee shop within the store. Pretty cool for the Joeys."
42,49,1,5674,"Great Sushi!  Very fresh but a little pricey.  The place has an excellent ambiance...great for celebrations!  Location at the Epicenter is great, especially if you are planning to go out for drinks afterwards."
63,71,1,4745,"Neat spot. I did not order the right dish.... But I will try again. Fresh fruit is great and the pineapple mango juice in a beer mug is fun and tasty. I think the waffle or crepe would be best, not so much an egg and bacon spot. This is not a greasy spoon."
151,170,1,4602,"Its now called lillies asian house and it was great.  we sat at the teppanyaki tables and it was standard meal service.  we got an order of spicy tuna rolls as an appetizer.  they were really tasty.  you get the salad, the rice, the vegetables, and your meat.  i went with the new york strip and my wife had the chicken.  i actually enjoyed the chicken more than my steak.  both were good and i was real happy with my meal.  it was beyond filling, lots of food.  service was exceptional, and it was a really nice meal out.  this was my first meal downtown and i would definitely return again to eat here again.  i would highly recommend it if you are downtown and looking for a nice reasonably priced meal."
88,94,1,8016,"Best food ever!!! We could literally eat here everyday! The service has been great, as well. We have tried a few different items and all have been mouth watering. My favorite is the miyagi san burger! Fries and sauce are great too. Drinks are great. Food is high quality, restaurant is clean, bathrooms are clean, air conditioned, nice ambiance, fair prices. Everything is awesome here. I definitely recommend this place."
71,76,1,2910,"It's a buffet, so I'm going to be intentionally brief here. This is worth it - every time. The drive, the wait, the price - it's worth it. So, just go here if you're around and you have some time to pig out for a bit. King crab legs for dinner. Holler and a half."
47,55,1,637,I LOVE Rays !!!\n\nWhen ever I'm in Phx this is my first stop. I always get the pizza and wing special. Large pizza and 20 wings.\n\nThey have the best wings in valley !!!
31,37,1,2751,"Fantastic space.  Friendly service.  Wonderful patio.  Our meals were all tasty.  Not a cheap place, but worth the money, to be sure."
21,21,1,7925,Good food. Fresh bread. Great atmosphere. Huge restaurant with plenty of seating. Always open.
83,90,1,251,"I've been here only once for lunch and I was really pleased.  I think the Bento Box is the best value, perfect for a quick lunch.  The decor is really surprisingly authentic to a neighborhood ramen-ya in Japan.  The staff were very nice.  I took a little tart with me as a treat for later, loved it, and wished I'd gotten more.  I'm definitely going back again."
60,67,1,8753,The skinny... the street tacos are AMAZING and the bartenders are very friendly and attentive. Great happy hour for a quick stop in the afternoon!  Love Love Love the atmosphere. Open air.  Not your usual Mexican restaurant.  Tequila with a twist! We enjoy the experience and will always come back.
58,63,1,7476,"My insurance company listed Airpark Collision Center as a repair option and I'm so glad I called. Great work, great service and great people - I couldn't be happier with the entire process. If I need any body work in the future there's no doubt who I'll call."
172,183,1,5653,"For years, 107.5 has handled the Alternative music needs of the Las Vegas Valley - but no one can deny that they only play new stuff, much of which is no good. For years, I wanted there to be a station that specialized in back-catalogue alternative hits.\n\nWith the arrival of 107.9 in 2005, I can rest at last.\n\n107.9 is an alternative station, but unlike 107.5, they specialize in back-catalogue stuff, be it early 70s punk like Ramones and Sex Pistols, or 90s alternative rock like Nirvana and Soundgarden. The station DOES play new alternative rock, but it's clear their focus is on alternative classics, and that's a good thing.\n\nThe best of old and new alternative alike, this is one of the most essential radio stations in Vegas."
142,175,1,3578,"After reading others reviews, I am now so sad that I missed the view of the strip.  We were seated in the \""""mall view\"""" area.  Not sure why, the place was not that full.  I guess that is the low-rent district....\nAh, but Sushi Roku, I can't stay mad at you.  Your sushi is delicious.  The Toro Tartare blew my mind (pinon nuts... Sushi Roku, you are a genius!) The yellowtail and fresh scallops were succulent.  The presentation was nice and the cocktails... quite inventive.  \nOkay, I guess we made up.  This will be my go-to sushi place in Vegas.  And next time, I'm gonna see that view."
56,58,1,4880,"I love this bakery. They are quite different from the traditional places. The frosting is smooth and slightly sweet, not whipped cream but similar in texture. They also have tons of cake  flavors to choose from and they can design anything you ask for. Give them a try."
108,112,1,1618,"I went to see a show at The Tempe Center for the Arts with my son few weeks ago. Rock the Presidents was showing and it was highly entertaining! The venue was incredibly beautiful. The music was fantastic, the cast was incredible, and the presentation was just phenomenal. We loved it! My son learned so much about the leaders of our country in a 70 minute show. There were students screaming and dancing, fist-pumping, having a blast rocking with the presidents. Thank you for providing such great entertainment! Deserves 5 stars!!"
97,113,1,8018,"We stopped here for lunch to get Subway. We were tired and hungry and sort of in shitty moods. I love donuts...and seeing Winchell's inside of a Subway caught me off guard, for one never seen a donut shop inside of a Subway...and second never heard of Winchell's period. The donuts were fresh, plump and full of sugary, doughy goodness. They were great, and it was nice to have something different for a change instead of the double D's."
23,23,1,8158,"Two words: Holy sh*t! Between the ice cream and the cookie, I was in heaven."
56,62,1,7886,Stumbled upon this place through Yelp reviews. Hard to identify My Key Coffee if you didn't know it was inside the cookie place--but so worth the search! Awesome iced toddy and ice tea. Can't wait to go back. I think I've found my summer spot
183,199,1,7889,"Since I heard this place was going to open, I've been wanting to go.  It's a museum about the mob.  And it's in the courtroom where the Kefauver trial actually happened years ago in Vegas.  What more do you need.\n\nNow I know, for what it is, it might seem a bit pricey, but if this stuff interests you, it'll be worth the money and your time.\n\nTheir website recommends giving yourself at least 3 hours of time to go through everything.  Make the time. Give yourself extra time. Don't try to squeeze this in with a bunch of other stuff.  You'd be surprised how time flies.\n\nThere are plenty of exhibits and video.  Interviews and pictures.  There are tons of artifacts for you to look through.  There is also a gun shooting simulation room which is kinda fun if you've never shot a gun before."
90,97,1,1888,"So I will upgrade my review of the store just because the store itself is kinda cool and fun to browse through. I still havent broke down and bought an iPhone or iPad, but maybe, just maybe sometime soon. Although I'm still waiting for the big announcement of the iPlug 5g cerebral cortex implant with internal cornea heads up display. Come on Steve, get on it, I really hate having to use my hands when I talk or text."
94,101,1,7033,"Good cocktail menu with a mix of seasonal classics and some new concoctions made up by the staff. Has a nice casual feel for such high-quality stuff. Interior is well designed in the popular old-timey hipster industrial style.  Staff seemed knowledgeable, though I think I out-drink-nerded our bartender at one point - she did not seem to know what a Martinez was when I referenced it - which says more about me than it does her probably. Recommended."
88,95,1,4856,"I rolled into this restaurant in my wheelchair and order up a pizza. Upon getting the pizza I wasn't too enthused, looked rather ordinary. I have never been wrong in my life! The first bite filled my mouth with joyous glee. I remembered the greatest times of my life, I laughed, I cried. After I finished my last bite I wiped away the few remaining delicious crumbs from my mouth and walked out, WALKED out."
69,79,1,8900,"Vanilla did a fabulous job on my daughter's wedding cake and additional cupcakes for the wedding party..  The cake, filling and icing were superb and the design was exactly what we requested. Their cupcakes are always moist, flavorful and inventive. We were loyal customers at the old location and will find them in Regent Square for our next special occasion."
57,64,1,7358,"Really like this place. Great bartenders serving a pretty awesome selection of craft beers. Board games, darts, arcade games, Jenga! And when it's warm enough the patio has a nice ambience. This place is totally on par with any good bar in Chicagoland, so yay!"
191,207,1,1922,"I love greek food so after a heavy night of drinking, a GYRO was the only thing on my mind. I went to the Fashion Show Mall with my boyfriend and headed straight for the food court and thought I died and went to heaven because there it was, a gyro spot! I briskly walk over and order my gyro, and it came out within 3 minutes! I also love eating my gyros with really spicy hot sauce and they had an awesome hot sauce there!! It was expensive, I think 8 or 9 bucks, which is the average when you're in Vegas so I'm not complaining. The night before I spent 15 bucks for a meal I did not enjoy at all so 9 was wonderful. They don't accept credit cards though, thank goodness I had cash otherwise I would have been a super unhappy camper. It's 2010, come on! Credit cards should be widely accepted, especially in Vegas! But other than that, tasty food."
61,68,1,1795,"The best buffet in downtown. This buffet has most of the common foods you see at regular buffets. It's much cheaper than the buffets on the Strip. If you like normal buffets, this one the best bet. However, don't expect food that you see at the Bellagio and Wynn buffets."
85,92,1,8023,"Decided to celebrate our 11th anniversary here, and we were not disappointed! The setting was romantic without being too stuffy, the service top notch, and the food outstanding. I had the sea scallops with a side of potatoes au gratin, and my wife had the tuna. Both dishes were terrific, and the server's wine pairing top notch. Will definitely be back, although probably at the more-convenient South Park location."
174,204,1,5183,"If only all hotels could be this quiet.....\n\nI took friends from the UK and sadly only had one night with them. We drove up from Woodstock VT where I co-own the Woodstocker inn...so I'm picky...and yet again the Gault came up trumps!\n\nI managed with the help of the door man to get the only free parking spot right outside of the hotel, and then found they had been kind enough to give me an upgraded room with a large tub....which was right up my alley as I love to sit in the bath!\n\nAgain the place was quiet and this time I had a vibrating king bed....shame I had no one to share it with! So I was happy...and they make a bloody good cuppa.....\n\nI will return with someone next time as those vibrations need sharing!!!!"
169,198,1,3639,"this 1 of my favs... eat practically every week... i usually pick up a box ( no fries, extra toast instead ) and bring it home to some fresh made rice, and vegetables on the stove... i'd like this place even more if it had some type of vege... now I'd give 5 stars but the only gripe i have, if it's called a gripe, is last two times i've ordered, came home and opened box, styrofoam is melted in some places where the chicken was touching it.  I'm not sure if im eating styrofoam or not when i eat the chicken.  It doesn't taste any different so i eat it anyway.  I understand that the chicken is so fresh its probably right out of the fryer and put in box but i wish there was some type of foil or something to prevent it from happening..."
195,205,1,6192,"Stayed at the Cosmo one night out of the 2 nights and 3 days my boyfriend and I were in Vegas for WPPI. We had the Terrace Suite with a spectacular view of the Bellagio lake and the Strip. The suite is ideally for two people but it was spacious enough for about 5-6 people. The only problem would be that there's only one king bed and the couch which is not a sofa sleeper. There are 2 full size bathrooms. One bathroom is near the entrance of the suite with a shower. That bathroom was pretty big. The 2nd bathroom is in the bedroom with a shower and a tub. Very huge bathroom. There's a small kitchenette area and oddly enough, there was no coffee maker. There's a little dining room area. The living room is spacious and has a sliding door to the balcony. The bedroom also has a sliding door to the balcony. The balcony is long with some lounge chairs. the suite is bad ass! Nuff said!"
21,22,1,6155,The guy is always friendly and willing to help out did a good job at sizing a ring.
41,42,1,9089,Very delicious & healthy. I came here for lunch with a group. We all had salads and sandwiches. Everything was very good and healthy. We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and would definitely recommend it.
46,50,1,4828,Nothing but noodles has a great selection of noodle dishes. Everything from Japanese to my Italian Favorites. I enjoy their spicy Japanese Noodles with Chicken. These guys also have bread sticks that are neck and neck with the Olive Garden.
43,47,1,5979,Couldn't be more pleased with the guys at Gaia. Not only was the bouquet beautiful but I was stuck late with jury duty on valentines day and they were kind enough to wait for me to get out.
26,27,1,311,Sonic is great. Great beverages and treats. This particular location is good. I have never had any issues with them.
23,27,1,8587,"This place is awesome. Simple, tasty, stylish, we'll be coming back here again and again."
14,15,1,6308,this store has everything.  They are so nice and helpful.
147,162,1,483,"First off, try the kimchi!\n\nI'd give Hodori five stars, because the food is really great. What ruined it for me was the service. The server, whose name escapes me, was very short with us; maybe it was an off day, but I don't know if that's really a valid reason. We're not a very demanding party of two, so we were a bit thrown off.\n\nDespite that minor setback, the bbq chicken and bbq ribs were take-home-for-leftovers worthy. Which is good, because you definitely pay for your portion. Go during lunch, which I believe ends at 3. Half-price meals, which still totals about $12 a person!"
36,40,1,5259,Had to try because of Yelp reviews. Food is pretty good. Had Furikake Chicken and wife had Oxtail soup. Huge pieces of tail. Will go back to try more.
66,69,1,3473,"Great service, nice trucks, friendly staff!! In typical Penske fashion they are organized, prepared for your arrival and on top of everything they do. Very impressed but not surprised. The one thing I will say is check out the back lot, it's miraculous how they get all the trucks parked in such a small lot!"
86,97,1,4269,In just one visit we were able to sample a wide variety of great Indian cuisine. The Chicken Tikka Masala is incredibly smooth. The Chicken Biryani is great for anyone who is not fond of spicier dishes. The Lamb Vindaloo is fantastic and the perfect amount of spice for the dish. For dessert we sampled the Gulab Jamun which is absolutely delightful. The service was excellent with plenty of beverage refill offers and check ins from the staff.
54,58,1,4803,"Very nice store.  The staff is great. The selection is great. The prices are crazy high. I would have loved a pair of shoes, but they are $300 pluses dollars for most & 49% off. Ouch. That is a but much for shoes!"
108,112,1,4823,"A wonderful park with just about every amenity you could hope for. You could bring the whole family and have something for everyone, there's a playground, dog park, basketball court, etc. I went for a hike, and there are several excellent trails with excellent views of nature. If you're in the east Charlotte/ University area, this is a great place to spend a weekend afternoon. You could lose yourself in the woods and almost forget you're actually in a city, and I mean that in the absolute best way possible!"
59,68,1,8409,Cool atmosphere with a great view!  Love the decor and the open air feel... reminds me of Seattle's Pike Place Market.  My favorite is the Chicken Pot Pie Bites and the Wrapped Dates... to die for!  Went yesterday and enjoyed special pricing for sangria and mimosas.  Love this place!
28,35,1,1383,Awesome! Honest and fair. Will do business again. I came from Gene's Auto Worx in Tempe.  Gene's is shady..
77,79,1,2183,"What a cool little cafe, with a DJ playing early in the morning, delicious berry corn muffins, and good coffee. A little loud for my taste at that hour, but quite a popular little joint, and lots of regulars. Cool artwork on the walls. I was staying nearby for a few days, and for me, this was definitely the best part of this neighborhood."
144,149,1,1768,"I absolutely LOVE Southwest Airlines. Many of you already know about the 2 free bags, low prices, and great service. Something however that shocked me was when I needed to cancel my flight, they made it such hassle free. All I remember was before with AA that I went through such loop holes to try to cancel a flight and they charged me fees on top of overprices tickets. But with Southwest, I was able to call the night before to cancel my flight and they send me a confirmation right away. I just used those credits to rebook another flight and I got the low prices offered on the site and there was no charge to rebook. Excellent service and motto. I will always fly southwest if I can!"
46,50,1,2673,"This is a real treat for anyone who wants to get some faith back in great restaurant food that is not overpriced, especially considering the quality of food they serve: organic meats, never-frozen fish, and generous portions."
52,56,1,7328,Jesse came out today and sprayed our condo for scorpions. He was super friendly and obviously knew what he was talking about. Explained many solutions for our horrible scorpion problem. Great price as well! I'm excited to see the results but Jesse was awesome.
26,28,1,4352,"We went for the 1st time last week.  Great service, good prices & amazing food. Will definitely be going back."
24,26,1,1765,"I love the new terminal!! more organized and modern.. However, they need to put more coffee shops/restaurants"
66,74,1,7477,"So, I had never gotten a spray tan before this experience.  It was surprisingly positive.  I thought I'd come out of there looking like that old chick in Something About Mary...but it looked FABULOUS!  It looked completely natural.  The whole process was quick, professional and comfortable.  I loved it and will be back."
81,90,1,6070,This place is great! The burgers have a unique flavor and they are a little on the greasy side but that's just the style. The customer service is great; the staff is friendly and attentive. It's nice to have someone stop by your table to make sure you're enjoying the food even though it's only a burger joint. They also serve alcohol if you're into burgers and beer.
64,69,1,3312,"I love this theatre not a bad seat In the house we saw Lisa lampenelli and she was amazing!! I like the fact they have cocktail waitresses so you don't have to leave your seat which is very annoying to have to all get up because someone needs to leave their seat and get by, this prevents this."
190,207,1,5554,"For beer connoisseurs, this is the place to go to. Every week they have different beers and usually over 20 beers on tap every night. They also have alot of hard to get beers in bottles. Best of all the have a cask beer that they open every friday. I have been to the bar more that 10 times and everytime I come there is a different list to choose from. I do not think I have had the same beer tqice at the bar.\nThe bar looks more like an old fashioned bar without tvs. At night the bar is rather dimly lit, but still a great ambiance. The most surprising thing, is that many of the beers are priced around 4 to 5 dollars which most bars would charge 6 dollars for. Being from CA I am happy to see alot of Stone brewery beers which are extremly tasty. Many of the customers are young people who are in grad school or are working, with the atmosphere really laid back."
82,92,1,2701,"We were told to get the prickly pear margarita and it did not disappoint!\n\nWe had to wait a bit since the outdoor patio was closed. But that was a good thing as it was quite chilly outside.\nOne of our party doesn't like very spicy food and the waiter was very accommodating with putting sauces on the side for her.  The food was quick, hot, and delicious."
121,128,1,1783,"I have lived in Las Vegas for about 4 years and this was by far the best meal I have had here. The service, food and wine were excellent.  Hugo's Cellar is an old school dining experience. It is like going back in a time machine to how things used to be.\n\nThe salad cart was an impressive and unexpected addition to a wonderful steak.  Both steaks were cooked perfectly and had a seasoning that matched the meat well.\n\nWe dined late so we only waited about 10-15 minutes but if you want to visit during peak hours I advise making reservations."
202,229,1,2249,"My friend and I decided to come here because another restaurant we couldn't enter because we were not 21 and for the fact that its Bobby Flay's restaurant. Thank goodness we came here because it was awesome! We came here for brunch and the staff all greeted us with warm smiles and immediately we were seated. We came in around brunch time so we had the brunch menu. I ordered the spicy scrambled eggs and my friend ordered the blue corn buttermilk waffles but before all this came an assortment of bread. All of the breads were warm, soft, and delicious! Both entrees  were outstanding. The ham egg and biscuits in the scrambled eggs were phenomenal and the Waffle was crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, and the portions and prices were extremely good. The waiters and waitresses were also awesome and always refilled water and bread without us asking. It was definitely worth the 40 dollars we paid for such good food. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas and this place does not disappoint!"
88,96,1,5617,"The sichuan food is excellent. We ordered dan dan noodles, fried fish with peppers, and homestyle beef. The dan dan noodles were okay, but unremarkable. The fish, however, was amazing. It was perfectly cooked and the dried and Sichuan flower peppers are still making my stomach and tongue tingle. The beef had tons of peppers of different types; pickled, dried, flower, and more. This meal was certainly delicious and memorable."
61,63,1,7217,I really loved the professional level of service that I received from Francesca. She was extremely knowledgeable about the product and it made me feel more confident in my decision. I felt as if I was getting quality service and was extremely pleased with my entire visit to see Francesca. I would definitely return again!!
321,373,1,3127,"Yesterday I decided it was time to introduce another friend to one of my favorite restaurants in the East valley.  We went to the Tempe location which is a lot farther away from home than the Mesa location.   But that doesn't matter because the drive is always worth it.  I like this location because it is the original.  \nThis time I decided to skip the appetizer to save room for dessert.  I still had the usual very large Hoegaarden to start and ordered the very new and not on the menu \""""Spicy BBQ Chicken Pasty\"""". Anything with spicy and BBQ deserves a shot and it was delicious.  \nThe chicken was tender and juicy, the BBQ sauce had some kick to it, the jalape\u00f1o and grilled onions were a great touch.  I am not sure yet if this may be a new favorite but if it weren't, it would be a close second.  Only one thing could make this night more perfect....well....maybe two things but I will settle for the Banoffee pie.\nIt has been a while since I had the Banoffee pie and I don't know why.  Who doesn't love graham cracker crust, homemade caramel, bananas and fresh whipped cream?  With every spoon full you get everything, the crust is incredible, the caramel is sweet, the whipped cream is delicious and the bananas are perfect.  I was only able to eat half of it so I brought the other half home with me.\nAnother perfect meal from a great place to eat, drink and be satisfied....anywho.  I know it's 7 am but I am heading to the refrigerator for the other half of my Banoffee pie."
68,74,1,8709,"Adam is one of the best, most honest biz owners around. Oh and did I mention he freaking ROCK when it comes to IT whether it's hardware OR software. He has fixed 3 of our laptops and would recommend him to anyone looking for a quick repair to a company looking for IT support with hundreds of employees. Thanks Adam!!!!"
144,147,1,1297,I really enjoyed the look of the hotel very peaceful away from other hotels. You can tell they really spent time incorporating the Indian aspect and cultural to showcase the great scenery and nature. Lobby is gorgeous and has cozy sitting areas around everywhere. They have a computers set up with calming music throughout. The pool is great I believe there is 3 and 2 hot tubs. A great water slide and the scenery of nature around you. Very relaxing. The rooms are super clean with a balcony to sit and take it in. I can't say enough about the staff at the door they always asked if they could help or if we needed anything! Shuttle to casino is easy to catch and a nice convenience! We'll done!
25,28,1,2742,"Saturday Dim Sum is Awesome!\nI eat for Lunch duriing the week, Great service Great Food, Good Prices!"
29,31,1,5706,I love this market!  The vegetables & fruits are always fresh & reasonably priced.  The sales associates are very helpful & friendly to boot!
40,44,1,5825,"What a unique place to visit!  Alittle touristy, but alot of great spots for photo ops.  There is not much, but the name was so interesting that we had to check it out!"
42,44,1,1803,Tried this place today for the first time. I had the curry chicken and my boyfriend had jerk chicken. Both were excellent. Also had the meat patty. So good. We will definitely be back !
129,149,1,9637,"Came here during a visit to see Uncle Ryan.  My son loved it (3 years old).  We were running out of things to do for him so it was a good find.  This place is great for a couple hours if you have a toddler or young child you want to entertain & tire out.  They also do bday parties, it would probably be good for a small group of kids in that age group.\n\nPros:\nClean\nprice: $8\nindoors so option for any weather/year round\n\nCons:\nIt's relatively small :  there are 4-5 large \""""bouncy houses\"""" and a toddler room"
22,22,1,9662,Great Service. Friendly staff. I loved the prices and treatments. They will do good. Highly recommended
35,39,1,9326,"My first time into a Pita Jungle in a few years, and now I'm a fan. Shwarma wrap was excellent but the garlic dip won over our whole table."
45,50,1,9202,This was my 1st time here. And I had a great experience.  Emily was my server and answered all my questions. And help me with the decision on getting a mto breakfast which was awesome.  Whoa! Thank you
68,73,1,518,"I have been here a few times for oil changes and have always been satisfied. This time Pete the manager really exceeded my expectations! I bought 2 tires and they hooked me up with an oil change, they beat Big O's quote for just tires by $200! For the same tire!!!  I highly recommend this Tire Pro's location!"
72,78,1,1496,"Absolutely the best dog grooming shop I've ever been to.  Sarah is an artist who must actually be able to speak to the dogs, she manages my demon with ease.  Diane is easy to work with and they always make time for my last minute appointments. Best shop in town, I will continue to use them exclus9aa I have for over ten years."
88,98,1,2825,"I've been to many bbq places in Phoenix, and Bobby Q has had the best food by far. I try something new each time I come and I have yet to be dissapointed. But, it's not just the food that's amazing; the service is some of the best I've had as well. One server in particular, Rishad, has always been friendly and made sure that everyone at my table was taken care of."
24,24,1,3703,Excellent pizza. They do offer indoor and outdoor seating but very limited so I find it best to take it home
64,66,1,5605,I have been going to Chapman Mazda for 2 years now. I always feel like they are knowledgeable and always know that they will take care of my car. I haven't had any problems so far and am happy with their service. I would give them 5 stars except for the wait time is sometimes pretty long.
93,108,1,7032,"After going several times always being served excellent food, I often recommend smashburger to friends.\n\nMy personal favorite is the build your own chicken sandwich. Standouts for me are the spicy chipotle bun and applewood smoked bacon.\n\nMy girlfriend loves their salads and I consider her standards very high. She doesn't often rave about salads unless they are 5 star.\n\nStaff is great and restaurant is clean. Smashburger is defiantly a must try."
32,44,1,673,"love the cozy fireplaces in winter, uncrowded/classy bar, flaminco dancers, waterslide, beach pool, lots of jacuzzi's, friendly staff, relaxing couches"
36,36,1,8771,"My wife took me here a while back, and I always wait for the day I can make it back over there. Very delicious, enjoyed the shaved ice they have!"
82,94,1,3037,"Came here for a free lunch at about 11am. There was both breakfast and lunch food available. No line to get in. Quick seating. Friendly staff. Huge pieces of tender and juicy prime rib, smooth and not too salty mashed potatoes, savory beef gravy, brussels sprouts, soft and creamy small cheesecakes for dessert. A really good meal. The only thing I missed was some shrimp as an appetizer."
93,97,1,3936,"Switch really was an interesting place. I love the atmosphere, it's definitely high-end. My down-to-earth jock/geek husband wouldn't go there with me on date night, so I went with a girl friend of mine.\nThe food was really great, and the server was lovely. If you want a fun night out, and a place that's worthy of your little black dress and sky-high heels, this is it!"
332,359,1,7957,"This is a place you must eat at if your in Vegas. My boyfriend and I ate there on a Saturday night and enjoyed the atomosphere.The meal and service was nothing but the best. Or server Chris was helpful, polite, and very attentive. We both ordered drinks and an appetizer to start. I had the HK Antioxidant and he had the STKhouse Martini. We ordered the Ricotta Ravioli. The portion was smaller than we expected, but it had a wonderful taste and we enjoyed trying something new by having an egg yolk in the ravioli. The bread they served was wonderful and the men who served the bread were knowledgable and explained each one. For our main meal we ordered the American Kobe beet, Beef Wellington, Loaded Baked Potato, and Brussels spouts.  The kobe beef melted in your mouth and was seasoned just right. I usually need A1 sauce for my steak, but with this one I didn't even think about it because it was seasoned so well. The beef wellington was also tender and flavorful. After seeing them make so many on HK I had to try it. It was a little on the salty side, but despite that I enjoyed it and could taste it in my mouth for days.  The sides were excellent and I really enjoyed the sauce that came with the Brussels sprouts. We wish we had room for dessert, but unfortunately we were way to full. Chris was attentive throughout our meal and was able to answer all questions we had.  He was a fun waiter and everyone there  greeted us and made us feel welcomed. Bonus, we saw Christina from HK working the line. I will defiantly be going to this restaurant again it was the highlight of my trip!"
261,289,1,9607,"Have been wanting to try this place for a while and finally made it. Arrived early enough on a Saturday where there will still a good selection of donuts. I am a purist and love a good glazed donut so I opted for that. I wanted to try another flavor but to donuts are HUGE and for the price didn't want to throw away a 1/2 eaten donut. The donut itself is very cake-like, the glaze had good flavor and was not overly sweet and the donut was not overly glazed. I took a few bites and left the rest sitting in the car while I ran some errands. A while later I decided to have some more donut and letting it sit in the warm car was the key to donut heaven! After sitting the glaze soaked into the donut and they were both nice and warm.. even the BF agreed it was even better than earlier. I can only imagine what a fresh from the kitchen donut tasted like there, drooling thinking about it.\nThe prices are higher than a DD or KK, but you are paying for local ingredients, locally made product and not some pre-fab box/bag filled with ingredients you cannot pronounce donut. I suggest following them on FB so you can look at yummy donut of the day photos and most importantly know when they have sold out!"
30,30,1,4900,Excellent service. HUGE range of beers to pick from. Great place for anyone who is into beer. You can find something for everyone there.
128,132,1,4264,"In the past eight years I saw this place truly become the best coffee spot in all of the Phoenix Metropolitan area, I am not even able to find an equal in Austin sadly.  I originally went when it was only one office and eventually was expanded to triple the size.  If you want true coffee, made the right way, with a friendly upbeat/hip atmosphere this is the place. Even though I do not drink I believe the expansion into brewing is a great one as well as having real Teas for relaxing and just hanging out.  If you love coffee, if you love hanging out, if you want to relax, go here."
113,121,1,5957,"I am a fan of the pressed panini. To me, it's a bit pricy for an every day lunch spot but the portions are good and salad is great. Also amazing illy coffee.   They also have an outside seating.  The owner is very personable and staff are really friendly so it make it even more enjoyable lunch time.\n\nNote: Get there early if you do not want to wait on the long line! It's worth the wait but if you have limited time to grab a bite get there early or order by phone before heading over."
18,20,1,2473,"i came here three times on a six day trip to vegas, nuff said."
23,27,1,2484,"Outstanding food, service, portions, ambiance, prices/quality ratio... all-around tough to beat!"
50,56,1,9431,"Loved the welcome surprise! A sample of their cake bites on the house! We tried the strawberry shortcake and toasted coconut cupcake, the bread was delicious! Moist and flavorful! The frosting was a little sweet but with the bread it was good!"
24,26,1,7093,"So delicious! We had ribs, brisket, and a selection of sides. Absolutely worth the drive from Georgia!!"
38,41,1,7977,"Great, friendly staff that are very knowledgable. Did a great job on a memory upgrade. Did the work in minutes while I waited. Wonderful experience, my new go to place."
42,47,1,6700,"How have I not been here before?  After 10 years down the road, I finally checked it out.  What a treat.  Great food!  Try the double chicago dog and get some fresh cut fries!"

95,101,1,6107,"I'm not sure what else can be said about MIM that had not already been said by others. If you're into music you have to come by if you're in the Phx area. It is $18 for adults, but they give this really cool audio guide to use while there which helps a lot. The museum itself is very large and ultra modern. Make sure and visit the artist gallery on the first floor. Also jam with others in the Experience Gallery too."
260,290,1,1046,"I've been coming to El Burrito since I was in Middle School and it's still one of my favorite homegrown Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas.\n\nI've never really had a bad experience or bad food at this place because I pretty much stick to three things on the menu because each of those items are so good that I just never decided to branch out and try anything else.\n\nThe complimentary chips and salsa are always an awesome start to the meal. I usually follow that up with the Noodle Soup. It's pretty salty, but it'll warm you up on a cool night and it tastes great.\n\nI usually get one of three entree plates every time I go, which comes with the aforementioned soup.\n\n1) Two Chicken Burritos w/ Red Sauce\n2) Two Tamales\n3) Carne Asada\n\nEach of the items comes with the typical fixings, rice and beans and whatnot. Each of the items are equally tasty, and if you get the two burrito plate you will DEFINITELY have leftovers!\n\nI usually cap the meal off with the sopapillas, which are cinnamon-sugar covered pieces of dough that are absolutely delicious. \n\n:) I highly recommend this place, as a loyal customer for most of my life."
37,40,1,8047,"Nigiri tasting menu was excellent, price for fatty tuna is actually 1/4th what you would pay on the strip at 6-7$ each, and higher quality to boot!"
51,53,1,1642,"We went on a Tuesday in summer.  We had such a blast.  Short wait times, great rides, lots of options. We spent the entire day there and still didn't do all of the rides. Bring water shoes to protect your feet."
23,23,1,7920,"Great food, great atmosphere and great staff. Absolutely love this place. The sweet potato fries are bomb!"
113,122,1,5162,"We bought pre-sale tickets for Afrojack. Tickets for guys was $30 and gals it was $20. Venue is pretty cool, inside you could see the dj and the dance floor, lights. Lots of places to sit and stand around. It gets crowded but you could go outside and enjoy fresh air, dip your feet in the water as well. Drinks are expensive as to be expected, but really a fun atmosphere and vibe. Lights not as good as Hakkasan, but more room to move around and it was interesting people watching. We had a great time."
24,27,1,9673,"Great new spot in the Bethany neighborhood. Great games and cocktails, like it's sister bar Little Woody's!"
168,182,1,5829,"On a business trip in WI and wanted to try something different for supper.  I definitely found a great type of food that I have managed to miss until now.  Korean food may replace Thai as my favorite Asian food.  I had the kimchi jjigae which is a kind of cabbage stew with onions and lots of other wonderful veggies.  I had the tuna but could have chosen pork.  The tuna was wonderful and the soup brought together so many wonderful tastes and textures that I will definitely be searching for Korean food when I get back home!  I began the meal with an order of spring rolls which were crispy as few restaurants can accomplish.\n\nService could not have been better.  If you are in Middleton, Wi and looking for some awesome combinations of subtle spices, warm and friendly service and an enjoyable evening, you should definitely try this place!"
25,27,1,5271,"Took the family...The portions were generous & the food was great. I recommend it, if in the area."
33,39,1,8881,The best Chinese we've found since moving to the valley!!! Duck fried rice very different and full of flavor! Hong Kong style Beef Brisket also very Good!!!
46,49,1,14,"Fun bar, and instead of typical bar food they lean towards Greek dishes. The blue grass jam on Wednesdays is a lot of fun and not too loud to still enjoy a conversation. Decent beer prices, pretty good selection."
136,150,1,5419,"I heart Fresh & Easy.  They have the best sales and really fresh food, hence the name.  This is the first store I have purchased ground beef and could actually touch it without getting grossed out.  Hardly any blood and packaged well enough not to need a seperate wasteful plastic baggy.  80/20 beef under 2 bucks a pound, well under two dollars.  I am impressed.  They don't have checkout lanes, you do it yourself, however I got a friendly greating from the staff.  I would have taken the nice lady up on her offer of free food, but I was allready so full stopping in.  Maybe next time because there will be a next time for sure."
214,242,1,4132,"It is no New Orleans but the food was surprisingly decent for a chain restuarant.  The seafood was fresh and cooked well.  I had the halibut with the Diablo sauce.  They are great with mixing and matching sauces and fishes.  We also ordered a dozen raw oysters and oyster pappadeux.  There are hints of southern style cuisine such as dirty rice, crawfish sauce, and any seafood you like fried.  As for actual taste, I didn't get much southerness from the flavors.\n\nThe second time, we got the seabass and two of us got the all you can east lobster. The seabass was cooked well and the sauce was tasty. The lobsters came with dirty rice as the side and it was pretty good. The lobsters are a good decent size and good quality lobsters. I finished 5 of them and the other finished 9 of them. I think eating 3 would be good. i cant say it is necessarily a good deal because it is just eating too much lobster unnecessarily. The time in between each round of new lobster fluctuated a lot and the service was just decent."
163,179,1,349,"I feel like I have come full circle.  I started at this location 8 years ago.  Then Alisa was assigned to the Scottsdale location and of course, I had to follow her. Now she is back to the original spot, it is farther for me, but I will drive to bfe for her.  I cannot tell you how many times I get stopped at malls or on the street an inquired about my hair color.  Just yesterday I had a lady asking me if it was a single process hair color.  I told her it was not.  It requires the expertise of Alisa to make it look this natural.  When Alisa was on maternity leave the first time, I was impatient and I went somewhere else, and they left me brassy.  The second time Alisa went on maternity leave I wore a hat for a while."
100,148,1,7235,"After a few hours hanging out at the bar, I was in the mood for a Fatburger.  I ordered a Large Fatburger with Cheese.  The wait was the usual 15+ min....standard for Fatburger.  I appreciate the fresh food, so I don't mind the wait.  The Burger was awesome as usual.....it didn't have a chance.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EzUypdlXXX75D_Cj14DnuA?select=ZlevLbfaM4ZX2BkAxIQNow\n\nReturn Factor - 90%"
42,52,1,5572,"Fun place to shoot the shit with some friends while avoiding the madness of clubbing, gambling, and the rest of the debauchery at Vegas.  Bartenders are cool.  Decor is nifty.  Atmosphere isn't overbearing."
75,82,1,6870,"Strictly stopped because of the reviews. Got a taco al pastor to go and a burrito de asada to go. The place is a little loud with music. The burrito and taco were good but not the best I've had, no napkins on my to go bag. Overall descent place to eat and/or have a drink. Definitely will try something else next time."
61,64,1,3497,"Great cheap homemade Chinese comfort food ... Very easy to get to and the owners there are very nice to everyone.  They talk with you see how your days are and make sure everything is good in your life.  Overall service was excellent, it's right off the light-rail stop too in Mesa!"
78,89,1,1732,"This place is amazing, especially our dogs' vet, Dr. Samoska! He is very knowledgeable, friendly, and patient. He would take his time to answer any questions we have. Most of the staffs there are also very friendly and knowledgeable. Banfield (Petsmart) offers various affordable discount plans that cover dental prophylaxis, comprehensive exams, etc. I highly recommend this pet hospital to others."
21,28,1,7130,great chai   !!!  this place has alot of room to move around and enjoy your coffee and wifi...
9,9,1,4337,Great food and very friendly staff.
80,84,1,2239,What a find! My boyfriend did some research and found this place to surprise me. I am so glad he did. The burgers were delicious and the mint chocolate shake was perfection. And the service was phenomenal. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure our group had a fantastic experience.\n\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves a good burger. Go and enjoy!
128,140,1,8775,"One of my new favorites! The food is great; we've been there twice and service was awesome both times. Prices are also very reasonable, especially given the quality of the food.\n\nI had the miso ramen, my husband loved his oxtail curry. We also had a mango tuna roll (?) which was delish - the fish was really fresh. A bit too much garlic on the chili garlic edamame, but that was good as well.\n\nThe restaurant is a lot larger than it looks from the outside and is really nice inside. It looks like they have a private room. \n\nWould definitely recommend!"
24,25,1,7198,"Little hole-in-the-wall place with a slightly limited menu, but big on taste and freshness."
71,76,1,4607,"This place is a little gem! I am so glad that there are good places to eat in the Arboretum. I went here recently with a group and everything was delicious! I had the N.C. Shrimp and grits. It was very filling and delicious, although it still can't compete with Charleston's. Very good food and excellent service!"
192,221,1,4787,"Felt like I was in a great bistro in Paris for the locals.  Not touristy at all and the wild menu items were great.  A bit out of the way, but cabbie got us there fast.  Loved the foie gras poutine for a started and bison tongue.  This was great peasant food, not for snobs, so right up our alley and this also felt like a neighborhood place, not artsy-fartsy.  Sometimes you don't need fancy to enjoy a great meal.  Everyone around us seemed happy and I'm glad we followed the hotel's advice and went early.  It is a usual old city bistro in that it is small and when it gets busy, it's really cramped.  If you want space, get out of the old city and go to something new.  This isn't for you.  Everything we had was fresh and they were receiving vegatables from a farmer while we were there, nothing wrong with that - especially if you're into local and fresh."
180,190,1,7435,"Flex and Fit is the new gym at the Duke Energy center and I love it already!  I went for their hot yoga class this past Wednesday and it was a really good workout and fun.  The facilities are really nice too. I haven't gotten a chance to try out the air yoga hammocks, but I saw them and I can't wait to try that class.  It looks like they will also have spin classes and other workout classes and I saw free weights.  I'm really glad there is finally a quality yoga studio that offers other forms of exercise as well.  The cooking classes look like they will be really interesting as well, I will update my review once I have had a chance to try it.  The location is also really convenient and you get 2 hours of free parking which is key.  I'm really glad Charlotte is finally getting some gyms that you'd normally only find in bigger cities!"
152,162,1,1747,"a trip to las vegas isn't the same anymore unless it's at the ritz! l love the atmostphere, the service, and the free spa!! l spent about 2 whole days lounging around the pool/spa enjoying the relaxed calm that comes from being away from the strip :) will always recommend this to friends who want to do something different for their vegas trip! of course it always helps if you know someone who works for the hotel so you can get the rooms for half price!\n\nthe food is ok, definitely worth the drive into the strip to eat dinner. the gambling is fair at the other hotel, not too crowded and plenty of slot game selections. but the spa and the 24 hr pool is what puts this hotel above all others"
116,120,1,5071,This is a great little theatre. I have been to several theaters here in Charlotte and this is very similar to most. It has a great reception area for a drink before the show. I think this waste first time sitting in the balcony. I was on the right side and there were definitely parts of the stage I couldn't see. But over all it was a great experience.\n\nThe parking lot near the theatre was full so we parked at the 7th street station which was only $5 because no other events were going on.  It was only a block away.
62,66,1,7070,"YUMMY food!\n\nsuch good red wine.\n\ni have no idea what we ordered, but every single dish that came up was really really good.\n\ni wish i knew spanish so i know what we ordered, but give it a try...it might surprise you."
49,55,1,1593,"This is a great place for sandwiches. I had a cheesesteak last time I was there and it was great. The cheesesteak here is made with mushrooms, peppers, and provolone cheese. Everything I have tried here has always been very good."
145,159,1,8646,"I really liked this place! They have several options for pedicures-some organic products even used. But, the REAL reason I was so impressed by this place was the quality of their manicure!\n\nHow many times have you gotten a manicure and like, literally, that week your nails chipped? (the answer is all the time) So, imagine my surprise when my manicure lasted almost 2 weeks! This is the regular run of the mill manicure that I received and it was awesome.\n\nEverything else was pretty standard for a salon--the people were really nice, it was clean, etc.\n\nMy only tip: the new hot trend is to offer a free beverage ;) Just a tip."
21,24,1,3838,Everything was delicious however their Greek lemon chicken soup was the best I've ever had. Amazing!!!
36,39,1,29,The people aren't lying. This lobster roll is drenched in butter and guaranteed to be a key contributor in your untimely death. You better love it or leave it alone.
12,14,1,8236,Loved the breakfast! Protein Berry Pancakes and eggs!
172,186,1,2534,"Went there with the hubby and some friends. The food quality was amazing. Which is not surprising from a place like this. I've always wanted to order lamb at a high quality restaurant to see if there was a difference in the gaminess of the meat. Big difference! So I had the lamb and sauteed mushrooms. The meat was cook to perfection. However, i was a little surprised by the amount of the side of mushrooms. It was only enough for 1 person. Not like Craftsteak at MGM where you can order a few sides and share them with your guests. But overall the lamb was good. I had a bite of steak from my husbands plate... The steak, in my opinion was average... but i think it had a lot to do with the way my husband eats his steak. I like mine medium rare oppose to his... medium well."
45,51,1,6022,"This place is perfect! Somehow, it can accommodate a family setting with children and a typical scottsdale bar hopping crew at the same time! It has delicious food but the drinks are unbelievable. BEST BLOODY MARY in town!!"
103,106,1,5968,"I love this club because there is so much space! You do not have to be on the dance floor to dance because of how much space there is. There's a ton of tables for bottle service and the place itself is very trendy.  And ladies there are plenty of bathroom stalls! I went to the bathroom like 4 times and did not have to wait in line. As for music the usual top 40, electro  Vegas style etc I was pretty drunk but I  had fun and would love to come back."
47,54,1,8671,"Absolutely luv this place! Tina is my go-to manicurist & she's amazing! Never have I bleed from her doing my nails, always friendly & we talk the entire time! Lol I'm glad I found this place!!"
28,29,1,4509,"Visited here awhile back. Was a nice experience, first time to visit. Very good art museum and gardens to compliment the views."
144,158,1,80,"In 79 reviews, no one has given this place below 3 stars.  That should tell you all you need to know.  Consistently good bar food in a quiet, pub-like environment. Service is always consistent, too.  Nothing fancy - but that's perfect for me.  Go for the London Broil sammy at lunch.  Reasonably priced and delicious.\n\nIf I had a magic wand and could change a few things about this restaurant, I'd focus on parking and adding more tables.  Street parking in a quiet neighborhood can be limited.  I've been here a handful of times when there has been a line out the door with people waiting for a table.  Both faults, however, are incredibly hard to control."
34,34,1,7362,"Great fresh food! Give yourself time for lunch hour, as it is fresh so it takes a little bit longer but not bad! Not bland! Great service!"
59,67,1,8833,"We got lunch to go one Saturday afternoon, it is a small, family-run neighborhood restaurant.  We got the chicken kebab salad and the chicken kebab plate with hummus on the side. It was pretty decent-fast service and the chicken kebab meat was wonderful. We'd go back."
62,69,1,3465,"I have used Gloria's Blossoms for many corporate events where balloon bouquets where ordered.  On each order, I have received exceptional customer service which was often above the norm. The manager is very personable and flexible in scheduling set up and delivery.  I recommend this service and will utilize them again in the future."
70,75,1,7639,"Here is a little ale-house gem in old Phoenix that it worth spending some time in.  The place is so refreshing, clean, and relaxing.  They have 6 beers on tap, and sell beer and kegs to-go.  The beer is great, the logo is is timeless, and the packaging is classic.  Love this place already!"
73,79,1,5787,"Yeah it's expensive, we know! I come here for sneakers. Balenciaga sneakers are somewhat hard to find specially in Arizona. Barney's gets them but they sell fast. The employees will contact you if you want when they come in to assure you get what you want. Overall nice place staff is friendly. I stop By Everytime I'm in the area."
89,100,1,3767,"We stopped in here after reading the yelp reviews, and it is a really good place. The restaurant is pretty small, but the food was good.  We ordered the beef wraps, beef curry, and a beef and noodle vegetable dish, along with a durian slushy and banana mango smoothie. We had stomachaches eating at wahoos before, and this place is so much better. The price was good too, and I felt full after eating here."
89,98,1,1247,"Great coffee, excellent tea, and astute service is what you will find here.  They  have a limited selection of breads and pastries if you're hungry, and the wireless internet can be unreliable at times.  It's always clean, and it's usually easy to get an outlet.  Steep & Brew does attract a decent number of non-studying people which may make for loud distracting conversations, so bring your headphones if you have ADD like me."
45,48,1,6631,Small Ramen shop with a simple menu of a handful of ramens all for about $7 a bowl. The service was fast and the food was great. Good food at a great value just minutes away from the Vegas strip.
122,135,1,6811,"Can be a bit crowded at rush hours but not bad overall. For those people who think that Planet Fitness discriminate against people who work out with intensity then you haven't been to a PF or are doing it wrong. Wipe the equipment when you're done, rack your weights and don't slam the weights. Fyi if you are slamming weights then it's too heavy for you.  I crush the workouts and never have had the lunk alarm go off. \n\nThey are open 24-7 and the Black card membership is only $ 20 a month for any gym in the country. Can't beat that deal"
40,45,1,106,"HOHO CHERRY HOUSE, not to be confused with a brothel, offers average food at cheap prices. Fast delivery and friendly staff. No matter what protein you pick it pretty much tastes the same."
204,210,1,8200,"I have eaten at this place many times and it has become my favorite Indian restaurant in Las Vegas. Indian food can get expensive but this is reasonable. The superb food way out weights the cost. I try different dishes each time I go and have yet to be disappointed. If you are not sure what to order or if you will like it, they have a lunch buffet that has a pretty good choice for you to sample and again very reasonable. Meat dishes are my favorite but they have a good portion of vegetarian dishes on the buffet too. Dal Makhani is my favorite vegetarian dish , but all are good. They always have 4-5 different chutney's to choose from with salad and fresh fruit. The nan bread is always fresh and the service is friendly. This is a rather new restaurant and as the word gets out it will get hard to get a table on Friday or Saturday night dinner without a wait. I would go now and be a trend setter by telling you friends. They will love you for it."
31,34,1,3886,"I love this place, you can always count on it for some great food at a great prices. The Tri-athlete omelet is the best."
49,51,1,4844,After a disappointing experience here the management staff went above and beyond to make sure our next experience was flawless. I can't thank Jennifer and Sean enough for reaching out and putting a personal touch on the visit. The desserts are beyond amazing!
319,351,1,3595,"So I figured for my 200th review it needed to be a 5-star rating. I didn't even know I never reviewed this place. Thanks Anne A. for pointing that out haha. \n\nI'm gonna tell you something, and I'm only gonna tell you once. Don't get the Octane 190. Don't get the Hurricane. Get both. Yes both.\n\nOk, so I was introduced to the Magnum 44 by my frat bros on a random trip to Vegas. Its a mix of Hurricane and Octane 190 with a shot of Everclear. According to my bros' standards, its supposed to be 3, which i half enjoyed and half regret. If you're looking to get super trashed, this is THE drink to get. I would know, I had it twice in one day and I was sauced the entire afternoon/evening. 23 bucks in their tallest regular bong covers you. \n\nBecause of Magnum 44 I stumbled into a jazz lounge at Bellagio and disrupted the ambiance talking nonsense at the top of my voice. Because of Magnum 44 I walked into the wrong hotel when I was trying to get back to my room. Because of Magnum 44 I threw up in the garbage can in front of the bathroom at MGM Grand and proceeded to finish in the bathroom like nothing happened. Because of Magnum 44 I blurted out in the taxi that I used to think 'this' was 'shit' backwards, but apparently my friend exclaimed that it was. \n\nMagnum 44 brings good times. I'll be in Vegas in a couple weeks. We will meet again soon Magnum. Cheerio."
51,58,1,6889,"Their Panang is so delicious here!  I could swim in their curry... it is so flavorful whether it's red, yellow, or green curry.  They have many lunch specials to choose from, and the service matches the food-- it's great!"
118,134,1,7087,Life changing experience.  Let's just say I was savoring my burps afterwards.  The prawns were so fresh and literally left me in awe.  The juices from the head coated my tongue with amazing flavors. The octopus was the best I've ever had. The tuna tar tar was very good but didn't really stand out for me. Heirloom tomatoes salad was divine and I don't even like tomatoes.  The mushrooms was the best I've ever had.  Service was OK. I expected a bit more for a $1k dinner for 5 but I think it was only the manager that was stuck up.
51,55,1,8064,"Tried this place out for the first time food was awesome! I would definitely go back the only let down was the service was kind of crummy, there server did not seem like she wanted to be there... maybe it was an off night or something"
29,31,1,2874,The food is great! I work late shifts so it's really cool to find fresh Chinese food at 1-2am in the morning.
20,23,1,0,"Friendly staff, same starbucks fair you get anywhere else.  Sometimes the lines can get long."
78,88,1,9001,"We had a very pleasant lunch at this place. For a group of four, we ordered a plate of stuffed mushrooms and a lasagna. The portions are family style and humongous!  Everything was delicious. Between their yummy bread of three or four kinds, the one appetizer, and one entree, we were very full. Most of the group had peroni beer. My white sangria was delicious."
68,85,1,367,Haven't ate here in years due to location but decided to have hubby pick this up for dinner last night.\n\nMu shu pork- amazing!\n\ncrab Rangoon's- Amazing\n\nChix and broccoli- pretty good broccoli a little mushy\n\nReally enjoyed dinner! check it out for some good eats
48,59,1,9293,Nice and reasonably priced for pedicures. Very sanitary with tub liners and pumice/emery boards that are disposable. Relaxing and enjoyable. The pedicure chairs are definitely the very best massage chairs I've ever sat in with upper and lower massage.
252,261,1,1285,"I have been here twice and for the most part I have had a lot of fun. A few things you should know beforehand. First, go earlier in the day if you don't want to be absolutely destroyed by teenagers; especially if you have younger kids. I took my girlfriends six year old daughter and she had a hard time competing with teenagers who would shoot her relentlessly for the points. After the first game, I got her to follow me around and she did a lot better (Perhaps they felt differently about trying to pick on someone who is 6'5 and 250 Pounds and I could explain to her how to play). Secondly, it helps to have an understanding of how the game works. Most people score a lot of points because they can hit all four bases of the opposing colors. Even if you only have two teams playing, there are three colors and the other two colors opposing bases can still be shot. (I learned that after game 1). Despite some of these issues my girlfriend's daughter still had a good time and the staff did a great job of catering to her. They also try and break the teams up so it wasn't us against teenage laser tag assassins.  Kudos to them for that. All in all, it was a good experience."
13,16,1,265,Pretty good subs. The pastrami is to die for.
179,188,1,2439,"I've stayed here before with family and I remember the experience to be awesome but now staying here first hand with my boyfriend I found it to be an amazing experience! The hotel staff were very friendly and they were very helpful with my late check out and didn't charge us a dime for it. They let us keep our room keys as souvenirs as well! Now the rooms were very clean, well furnished and comfortable. The only thing that sucked is we didn't realize that the room we booked didn't have a fridge or microwave, so the food we brought for bad. I should have read more closely online for the amenities before booking the room. They would of provided us with one but it would an extra charge. No big deal though. Overall my experience was amazing especially for the price we paid, it was a very good deal :) I definetly recommend staying at the luxor for vacation !"
54,59,1,2611,"Definitely very entertaining! I had the best original margarita! Service was awesome! Shannen was the best server we had for the week that we stayed in Vegas, and we ate out Everyday!!! Thanks again to the staff and a great show!!! I will definitely be back"
33,36,1,2233,"I like BLT burger better, but this is very good. Really good burgers made with what you want how you want, all served up fresh and yummy."
90,93,1,1575,"Papago is my favorite place to go for drinks with friends and family. They have new beers on tap every night. They let you sample their beer so you can make sure you like it. They have a large freezer section with over 50 beers to choose from along with the beers on tap. They have board games, darts and a big screen TV to watch the game on. I highly recommend Papago for a low key night out with friends!"
113,124,1,4505,"This is the spot to be early afternoon when you're in Pittsburgh. Any Pittsburgh sports clothing you are looking for is here for a decent price. The farmer's marketing is the reason I visit the Strip. I have found strawberries for $1! You can't beat those prices.\n\nThere are also boutqiues and other markets to browse through. Parking can be kind of a pain, but it is always worth it! The stores typically close early, but there is some nightlife. The Altar Bar, a popular music venue, has bands playing most nights."
94,105,1,6688,"I have driven by this restaurant everyday for the past several years and never given it a thought.  Last night I tried it and all I can say is wow.  Started off with a Patron margarita, which was very well made.  I had a fish and shrimp taco.  Both tasted extremely fresh.  My wife had the fish diablo, and it was the highlight of the table.  The diablo sauce is fantastic.  Give this restaurant a chance, you will not be disappointed."
105,112,1,2903,I grew up in Brooklyn New York home of Nathans famous in Coney Island.. it was just as good the hot dog had snap french fries were cooked perfect a little bit more expensive than when I was a kid but what do you expect on the Vegas strip at the Venetian hotel you're going to pay extra.. The service was fine they even give you a little pager once your food is ready they page you.. I would have given it a 5 star review but the prices were a little high but nevertheless I will be back
313,353,1,2625,"If I ever have a child, I want to name him Jean Philippe, but he will probably get beat up at school having a name like that.  The desserts here are absolutely decadent.  Not only do they taste good, but they are miniature works of art in themselves.  Pastry on the highest level is never overly sweet, and these are no exception.  The quality of ingredients is highly apparent the moment you take a bite into them.  Unfortunately our caloric allowances only gave room for my wife and I to order one apiece.\n\nThe strawberry shortcake was wonderful.  A very nice fruity strawberry flavor uncut by any of the red corn syrupy stuff you see in other places.  I had the vanilla eclair which was filled with vanilla pastry cream.  I think that they use Tahitian vanilla because it had a nice floral vanilla essence to it.  It was a full-bodied vanilla taste often not found in other places.  I did feel a little chalkiness to the texture which is from the starch they use to thicken it.  But, unless you make pastry cream on an ongoing basis, you may not notice it.\n\nDesserts here are not cheap.  At $7 a pop, they can cause sticker shock.  But are they sooo worth it.  Jean Philippe clearly demonstrates why he has received the award as Pastry Chef of the Year multiple times.  I don't think there are any bad pastries as I had some other ones when they were located in the Bellagio hotel.  The pumpkin cheesecake is also a seasonal favorite.\n\nDo not pass up the opportunity to get a bite here."
48,49,1,9159,Nice place. Was greeted by Dylan and he was a cool guy. They didn't have the equipment I was looking for however I will come back in the future. Dylan when above and beyond to answer all my questions. Great place
113,117,1,316,"Five stars due to this being the best Panda Express I've ever visited. The girl behind the counter was polite to the person in front of me OFFERING samples to them. When I stepped up she was super polite to me and offered me samples as well, and thanks to the sample I ended up getting the honey sesame seed chicken. Absolutely delicious. I asked for both noodles and rice and I expected the usual half-assed scoops of both but this girl hooked it up big time on everything! Despite all these bad reviews I will definitely be a repeat customer!"
56,64,1,623,This is one of the best NY style deli's I have been to! The sandwiches are ginormous and delicious. They definitely don't skimp on the meat! I would recommend this place even to the pickiest New Yorkers. They also have a breakfast that is bomb dot com!
64,73,1,4619,I recently had a great experience at Austin Village Eyecare.  The staff was great and I was able to set up an appointment in no time.  Dr. Bhat was thorough and took extra time to explain and discuss all of my options.  Extremely convenient and the office is very clean and modern.  Thanks Dr. Bhat!
48,52,1,9520,I'm a firm believer in juicing and this place delivers the goods! Friendly staff and great fresh selection. So glad I have one more option for juice! And it's right by my work so it's totally perfect for me.
144,151,1,2225,"I love Red Square and go there every time I go to Vegas. The attention to detail that went into designing this place is quite impressive. The decor is fashioned after and inspired by communist-era Russia and the bar is made out of dry ice. I have only consumed various vodka drinks here so cannot attest to the food, but they have an extensive caviar selection to pair with their vodka selection, which is vast. I usually get a straight, dry martini with some kind of high end russian vodka. This comes ice cold with a blue cheese stuffed olive at the bottom, soaking up all the booze. I have yet to do the vodka flight inside the subzero vodka freezer but that will be next on the agenda."
28,31,1,6998,"Amazing combinations of out of the ordinary things and flavors, our server was very knowledgeable and attentive. A+ from beginning to end."
179,203,1,6618,"Went back to Centurion after a wonderful day at the San Tan Wheelie Jam.  My friend and I were famished from all of our bike riding.  I called shortly before we left my house and made a reservation.  When we arrived, they seated us at a sofa, which was ok for drinks, but we requested to be moved to a table for our entrees.  They waitstaff was accommodating.  I got an item that's not on the menu, but was recommended by our server at my first visit to Centurion: gnocchi with white Irish cheddar sauce.  The waitress had to check with the chef, who said he would make it.  Oh, rich yummy goodness!  My friend had a pizza, and as on a previous visit, I felt I had the better experience by ordering their pasta.  Our waitstaffers were relaxed and flexible on this Saturday night.  Once again, I had a wonderful dining experience at Centurion."
164,179,1,8563,"Best burger I've ever had and best burgers on the strip! I'm very picky with my burgers but these are perfection! Everyone in my party of 8 were very happy with their meal. I loved it so much that I almost went there a second time during my trip to Vegas. I recommend getting the truffle parmesan fries with your burger..so good! I would also recommend the hummus and Maui onion rings for appetizers. The hummus is super fresh and unique tasting and the onion rings are to die for! Don't plan on being seated right away and they do not take reservations. You put your name in and they text you when your table is ready. In the mean time, you could walk around the miracle mile shops which are right next door or gamble a bit. The food is definitely work the wait!"
161,182,1,3142,"I joined my family in North Phoenix tonight at Restaurant 28.  As other reviewers have said, the establishment is a bit small for larger groups.  The owners operate the restaurant, they were nice, courteous and friendly.  The food was made fresh to order and did have a bit of a wait but it was worth it.   It was great to get my Southern food kick, from fried okra, fried gizzards and hush puppies to collard greens and fried chicken.   The BBQ was flavorful and you can taste the richness of the beef or pork that you were eating.  Even my nephew who is a really picky eater enjoyed their fresh fried catfish with sausage casserole, so that is a big plus.  Needless to say if you are in the area you should give this mom and pop restaurant a try.  I'll be back."
14,15,1,2478,Can not beat the 7.77 deal totaly worth it.
121,131,1,3057,"Cheap drinks! Im familiar with the one in NYC so I was super pumped to go to this one in Vegas. It was a late Friday night,  but there really we're not that many people there at all. The interior is beautiful and glittery. The bartenders were great. There was an outside section in back where someone was painting, an art show I believe.The whole energy of the Beauty Bar is different in Vegas. I can't put my finger on it, I just wasn't wowed... I didn't dislike it but I didn't Love it either.    Maybe it was bad timing?"
86,88,1,3755,Cheyenne at this location was absolutely amazing!! She was so sweet and fun and you can tell she actually really cares about the concerns and happiness of the customer. I was having a really bad day and was crying when I pulled up to the window and the moment she saw me and started talking to me with such a positive attitude it completely changed my mood!! Amazing customer service and someone should really consider giving that girl a raise.
67,67,1,6248,"I have been sending packages back home for several years from this store. The staff are always friendly and helpful, and help me to choose the most cost effective method. I was in there just today, and was helped by Alexis, who was cheerful, and got me on my way happily in no time! Two thumbs up!"
46,47,1,2943,Great place. Huge portions and very interesting food! Saw this on Man v. Food so I knew that I had to try it. What I got I didn't really like but what everybody else was eating looked amazing!
47,49,1,3625,This place is fantastic.  The staff is really friendly and professional. They were so quick I don't think they need to bother having chairs in the lobby.  Was in and out with cards in hand in less than 10 minutes.
84,91,1,9537,"I want to give 5 stars because the food is great. All fresh and really good. Saag paneer medium wow! All The bread options, hell yeah! The waiters are nice but not the most outgoing so don't expect benihana. Also not the fastest thus the 4 star. Did I mention the food is sooo good and fresh! Come for the food, drink to forget any service issues. Definitely coming back."
85,87,1,3984,"My wife generally hates shopping, but was in need of new clothes for the office. The wardrobe of a grad student would no longer do. Kristen helped her put together a number of outfits within our target budget and gave her a mini course in corporate appropriate fashion. She was super patient and amazing to work with. My wife couldn't have been happier! It was her first positive shopping experience since I have known her."
78,80,1,2316,"Awesome club upstairs called Moon I had a great time! The music was fantastic and the outdoor roof top had a spectacular view of Vegas. The service was fast with my drinks and the bartenders were entertaining to watch doing their little bottle tricks. I didn't care to much for the half naked chicks dancing around but, they gotta eat to I guess? Overall good times! Great DJ!"
56,61,1,4350,"I had my birthday dinner here Friday and it was one of the best meals of my life! The steak tartare, the onion bread, the whisky flights...literally everything was spectacular, including the service. We can't wait to make reservations on our next trip to Vegas!"
51,55,1,7870,Not only is the bbq close to me but I can also get gas and a car wash at the same location lol. The food is really good but the sauce is just so so and thats the only reason it's not getting a 5 star.
78,86,1,2167,"Great place. Upscale gay bar. I usually have fun here. THe only reason I give it a 4 star is because of the prices. I guess I am paying for the atmosphere? Anyway, same drink here that would cost me $7, I can get at another gay bar for $4. Other than that, definetly a great time and sometimes that $7 is very much worth it."
49,54,1,9217,"Lux Nail Bar in Chandler has some amazing nail techs but the best is Steven!! I am very very very picky and this man takes such good care of me!! He has been doing my nails for two years now, I love him!!"
203,223,1,9044,"Staying in town with some friends and read a few reviews on Helen's. Decided to try it and from the moment we walked in, I felt like I had been coming in for years. Lupe the hostess was so nice and told us everything about the menu and even gave advice about where to watch the Bronco game while in town. \nNow about the food, Orange juice was big enough to serve 3 people and at iHop this would have been 12 - 15 $$$. The portions are big enough to share and they will let you replace pancakes for toast and biscuits and gravy etc.. Anything we asked for was perfectly fine with them and made quick work of it. If you live here or are in town, stop at this pace because it's worth it! It's not fancy so if your looking for 5 star hotel food with oatmeal at $14 bucks a bowl, this is not your place. If you're looking for a killer comfort breakfast place with super nice people and killer prices, this is it! \nEnjoy."
94,106,1,7100,"So glad a friend mentioned this place. It's on the third floor of Cosmopolitan, past the sushi resto and down a long hallway lined with old album covers.\n\nI came for lunch, relished in the one person-deep line and had my large cheese slice in hand in no time. For about $5/slice, this is a great destination for after you've shopped/drank/gambled your wad and are looking for some cheesy, greasy comfort."
28,32,1,6593,Yelp has never let us down yet. We love the food here..affordable and was enough to fill up our bottomless pit son!
108,111,1,6620,I discovered this little gem out of coincidence when I was invited there for an informal meeting. We decided to go with the food-wine pairing menu and we were not disappointed. The food was nothing short of outstanding and the wine pairing very interesting and at times something I would never have thought of. The service was great and the owner stopped at the table for a long and very informative chat on food and wine among other things. It is a small restaurant so you may want to reserve a table. Great ambiance in this small restaurant.
92,96,1,5935,"Best customer service.  What sets this place apart is the attention you get from the people who truly care about you getting the right pair of shoes.  This may cause you to wait a little bit longer if you go at a very busy time.  Often, I've come here thinking I want something specific for my daughters and they are so patient about getting them fitted, and helping them choose the right pair of shoes that they will not outgrow in 2 seconds."
41,45,1,3532,"This is a really great theater to attend! The service is friendly, the theaters are clean, and I had no idea a matinee was only $5! It's centrally located and is easily accessible."
22,24,1,7608,"Cheap drinks, arcade games and corn hole. Nothing fancy, nothing pretentious. You could do worse."
168,190,1,3960,"Fibber's is a good time!  I've only eaten there a couple times, but the sheperd's pie was very good, as were the fish and chips and a couple of the appetizers.  \n\nMainly I go there on the weekends to knock back a few pints and see the bands.  The place is really poppin' when the Brazen Heads play, for example, and I don't see all the depressed and downcast people mentioned in one of the earlier reviews.\n\nI don't really get the thing about folks of different ethnicities being treated poorly at Fibber's.  I've been there with black guys and Indian guys, and none of the servers seemed to give a damn about their skin color.  They just poured the beer and collected the money.\n\nI'll be there tonight for the Great Guinness Toast, too!"
13,13,1,2127,"Fast Quick service. Great foods, Family and friendly environment"
32,33,1,761,Best Chinese take-out in Gilbert! We've tried quite a few but none as good as this one! Customer service is always great every time!
46,51,1,8398,"This place is fantastic. The food is really good. I always get the gyro. The salad is great. Hummus is ok. Pitas are warm and delicious. It is small, sort of mom and pop. Yummy!"
79,85,1,577,"been here dozen's of times, finally decided to review them. The food is a step above the average Italian restaurant and the Sangria blow's away any other we've tried and we've tried quite a few. The mood is good and the manager, John, makes sure you are properly taken care of from service to food quality. Try the John Cole for a tasty dessert after stuffing yourself"
102,111,1,765,"I've been going here since I was 12. I practically grew up here. There was a patch of time where it lost a lot of popularity. But great skate is back now. Filled with people every Friday and Saturday. The best lighting system, the best employees, the funnest environment and DEFINITELY the best sound system in arizona. If you're looking an awesome place to go with the fam or for bday parties, or even with your friends, go to Great Skate. You won't be disappointed."
50,56,1,4907,"I was actually pleasantly surprised by this place... not sure if it's because is was 1am, but the pizza was great and fresh. Prices were reasonable, location is great, and the garlic knots were yummy. I'd definitely go back."
68,75,1,6153,"Your standard gas and mart.  Very clean!  As some of you may know, the road from Phoenix to Las Vegas is fairly devoid of services for much of its length.  So, while driving in the dead of night, spots like these are oases.  Drinks, chips, gas, and bathroom, all with friendly service.  Thanks!"
49,52,1,5630,"My 3-year old took some beginning dance classes here.  She absolutely loved it, and the owner Melissa!!  The class was great because they did about 20 minutes of ballet, 20 minutes of tap, and then 20 minutes of gymnastics."
47,52,1,8645,"Awesome food, awesome service. The best way to do teppanyaki without breaking the bank or having to drive down to the strip. We have been here many times for birthdays, Mother's Day, etc. I highly recommend Eddy!"
48,49,1,304,"These guys are always fair,  have the best work ethic and never have a problem explaining everything in detail. They use the old-school weights, analog solution to an analog problem. No computers, and its dead on every time."
156,166,1,457,"Windy City DJs was wonderful.  Frank and Susan in the office did a wonderful job of sending us all the paperwork and contracts, and setting up a time to meet with us to discuss services prior to deciding on using their company.  Lee, our DJ, was incredibly organized and professional.  He called me the week of our wedding to discuss all playlists, ceremony music and timing, and the nature of what we were looking for at our reception.  The wireless mic we ordered was flawless, and the sound quality and lighting provided were perfect for our venue and guests.  The guests enjoyed the music and Lee kept in constant communication with me as well as our caterer and photographer.  We would whole-heartedly recommend them to anyone looking for a wedding DJ, or a DJ for any other event."
60,63,1,6332,"I recently was in Vegas for business.  We went to the pub for lunch to meet a client and the food and service took quite a while considering we had to cancel our next meeting.  With that being said, the place was really busy.  The food was great and the atmosphere was casual."
68,74,1,1941,"If you wanna real locals bar this place felt like it for sure.  I loved the fact that it's just an office space that's been converted into a bar complete with pool tables, darts, and you can even purchase liquor to go!\n\nNice low key vibe when you wanna get away from all the blingy goodness!"
262,292,1,3282,"Yummers! We got discounted vouchers at the Tickets 4 Less counters on the strip. Paid $3 to get the discounted price of $24.95 instead of the regular price of $41. The guy at the ticket counter said they sell the most vouchers for Pampas than all their shows combined. Good deal. The dinner was all you can eat of 10 meats. I have to say, my favorite was the roasted herb chicken. Some of the meat was a bit dry and tough to chew through, but I was pretty satisfied with the different flavors. There are some other brazilian bbq places where the meats just all start tasting the same. Another favorite was the bacon wrapped turkey. The turkey was really moist, but I think that's because it was processed. They came out in cubes on those long sticks. If I remember correctly, there were two types of filet mignon. I remember liking the one that wasn't with parmesan .\nThe service here was excellent. We brought our own wine. When we called, they said the corkage fee was $15, but it turned out to be $10. Our waiter and also a manager kept checking in on us and taking away our plates. Additionally, there was a separate buffet with lots of salad choices. I liked the pineapple salad, kale, and the fried bananas. Yummers again!"
30,32,1,5225,"The food here is pretty good. Our host Hannah was also real lovely, thumbs up to her!!! We will definitely be going back here."
54,56,1,3784,"I love the ambience and attitude in this place. The chicken wings are a little on the small side, but great flavors to choose from. Definitely going to continue watching sports in here from time to time. The service is decent and the prices are pretty fair."
128,143,1,1606,Bah!  It was wicked hot in here mid afternoon!  If there was AC I couldn't find it.\n\nI do like the place - kind of cool that it is right in the brewery.\n\nParking is an issue.  Street only so you may end up walking a bit.\n\nI was glad to try Four Peaks as I have been enjoying the Kiltlifter Scottish Ale since I arrived in the valley.  One of my favorite microbrews these days.\n\nI read in another review that they have good food and generous portions so I will be back to try the food...when the weather cools off!
18,18,1,532,I love coming here to watch the latest movies and spend time with my daughter!
56,64,1,8100,Amazing!!!! Robert returned calls quickly and managed our expectations on his arrival time! Our furniture and rug looks great!!! He took  extreme care and time with each piece!  We also had our vents done! We are extremely happy  with the results and his professionalism! Highly recommend Robert!!!
41,44,1,6956,"Really really cool place!  I got the shrimp over noodles dish, and my friend got beef over cattle.  Everything is so fresh and the atmosphere is awesome!  I'll definitely be back very soon!"
114,123,1,7727,If you are looking for pizza that's delicious and more on the gourmet side then this is the place for you! The seating are is very clean and looks friendly and cozy. I like that you can see them making your food and that everything is fresh and tasty. You can tell they take time putting thought into their menu and it shows. I will go there many more times and encourage everyone to try them out. Their side salads  with garlic creamy dressing are wonderful because they aren't just bagged salad. Their pizza by the slice is like NYC pizza and customizable.
6,12,1,2389,go here everytime......
53,63,1,5972,"Love, this place. And the Sangria's are to die for. Sunday they have an awesome brunch and Sangria's are half off! The food is great for dinner and the bread they bring out at the begining with the dipping sauces...EVERYTHING IS GOOD!"
166,181,1,1472,We came here for lunch on a Sunday and the food and service was pretty good. They have some  gluten free options but they list it on a separate menu with no pricing so matching things up is a bit of a pain. Just putting a gluten-free symbol next to options on the regular menu would make things easier. They do have gluten-free soy sauce for sushi and sashimi which is nice. Lots of food options from burgers to salads to sushi and sashimi so it is a good place to come to if there are people in the group who do not like raw seafood. Having lived in Hawaii for over a decade I am not sure where the Kona theme comes in as there is little Hawaiian about the place. That said the restaurant is nice though and the water tank behind the sushi/sashimi chefs adds to the atmosphere.
122,130,1,8183,"I just moved to the area 2 months ago and was looking all over yelp for a good, reputable dog groomer. I'm so happy I chose Villa La Paws! The price to get my dog all cleaned up and shaved, the works, was so reasonable. Very pleased with the work and how happy my dog was when I came to pick her up. They also were very accommodating to time a time constraint with me and had her done in time for me to pick her up before I had to work. The groomer was also happy to greet her when we arrived. Would recommend this place to anyone!"
29,32,1,782,Hot bagels is a quick easy stop on my way to work.  I always get the breakfast sandwich double toasted and have never been disappointed.
174,190,1,4712,"I guess we arrived right after their rush hour because there were no tables readily available when we arrived but about 60% full which can be understandable. But we were seated within 5 minutes, but the menus took another 5 minutes to come.\nI ordered the 4 course of salad, tandoori chicken, mixed vegetables, banana bread pudding, and a chai latte included in the end. Chicken was very tender and the salad a large order with even more salad placed on the same plate of the entree. Bread pudding very very good to finish. The gf had chicken marsala which was very sweet on its own but went very well with the garlic naan we ordered on the side. Main entrees were a bit on the smaller side.\nThe server was joking around a little, calling my chicken KFC when it came and saying the bread pudding came with ketchup and mustard. Funny guy."
118,125,1,487,"A huge thank you to Brian at Firestone! Yesterday evening I came into the shop ten minutes before closing. They put my spare tire on for me and had me setup to get a new tire in the morning. I got there at 7am and by 7:10am this morning I had a new tire and was off to work. Brian was friendly, quick and efficient. Before going to Firestone I had called Discount Tire to only get rudeness and a lot of sighs about them closing in 15 minutes. Thank you Brian for your awesome customer service! I will always choose Firestone over Discount Tire!"
56,63,1,9630,"Love the veggie sandwiches and the dutch crunch bread. A bit overpriced but the sandwiches are huge. They did miss a couple of ingredients on my sandwich a couple of times, like the habanero salsa. I just hope the place survives unlike all the previous establishments in this location."
42,44,1,6306,The four of us stopped in to share a pizza a get a few drinks before heading to another restaurant.  The pizza was really good and fresh.  The service was friendly and the drinks were good also.
4,4,1,5749,Good job
51,56,1,8649,"The Chicago dog, onion rings and chicken tenders are amazing!! I would recommend any of those to everyone! The only thing I don't like from there is the chili dog but other than that love Portillos! Oh and the shakes are great too!"
208,229,1,6712,"I wanted something delicious and a bit healthier than your typical fastfood joints, so I chose to visit this Port of Subs. It was near the Lowes that I was going to. What immediately caught my attention was the griller collection, preferably the pastrami! I added some provolone cheese, pickles, mustard, pepperoncinis, tomatoes & red onions. How ever they crafted my sandwich, it was sheer perfection! I highly enjoyed my meal earlier today.  Not only because it was delicious, the staff was just amazing! Kurtis, Tina & George, were exceptional! Very courteous, very friendly, and most importantly, the passion in what they do. I too, work in a customer service industry. So I understand how the system works. I will definitely be coming back to this branch, and tell my friends about it! If you get the chance, swing by and bring them business. You'll be glad that you did! With all the negativity happening all around us, it's refreshing to encounter such a small group that gives such tremendous positive light!"
95,99,1,6692,"This place was a fun and refreshing alternative to the conventional restaurant for date night. The menu offers creative combinations of toppings and then you pick the style of sausage you want and it's all served on warm naan. At first, I was given the wrong order, but the staff was friendly, quick to apologize and fixed their mistake. The food truck scene allows us to bring the dog and for $20, we had a delicious meal and a change of scenery. Awesome."
78,80,1,8596,"Jackie was great! My husband doesn't like photo shoots, but she made both of us feel really comfortable. She had tons of ideas and the pictures turned out beautiful! She's also extremely fast at editing and getting you your photos. We waited several months for our wedding photos, and Jackie had our maternity pictures edited in less than a week! Definitely a bang for your buck!"
52,56,1,5072,Had a great meal with friends and co-workers.  Had an easy time reserving a table for seven and the service was prompt and the food was enjoyable.  One of the things I like is the openness of the restaurant and the ambiance that is created.
23,26,1,3509,Pig dip and pancake were life changing. Fig and bacon scone was a close third. This place rocks!
60,68,1,4201,"How can you go wrong with BWW!! Great place to catch a game and maybe a few brews. Lemmon pepper, spicy garlic, and hot are the trio of flavors from a variety of flavors they offer!! With all the screens set up around the room there's no game you can miss!!"
106,108,1,2995,"This was the most beautiful ceremony, and if you get the photographer, they like to take a lot of pictures. But my only tip is to show up maybe a day before to sign all the paperwork and everything so that you won't be waiting around in your wedding dress while guest start to show up while they file the paperwork away. Other than that, everything went smooth. The drivers were awesome and knew all the side roads so we wouldn't be late. My husband and I had a great time and enjoyed everything."
9,11,1,3519,Best BOBA eva! Enough said.
250,277,1,795,"You must stop at this cafe! it's a must must must! You must make the trip from Phoenix! Shopping in Anthem? Even better! I've been coming here for 10 years, and boy, has it changed! But one thing remains the same - best pies in the whole dang state.\n\nIt used to be a little hole-in-the-wall that was never busy... now they're expanded and are slowly creating (what I believe to be) a pie and dessert empire! More often, on weekends, you will find yourself waiting for a table, but don't worry, there's plenty to look at! I will be honest, I am used to some traditional \""""diner\"""" service, with waitresses that don't usually want to give you the time of day - but on my last visit, I had the kindest, smiliest, most affirming waitress I think I've ever had! \n\nI'm always torn about what pie to order when I come - Jack Daniels pecan? One of the amazing berry crumb pies? A foot-tall coconut cream pie? Well, this past time I chose the JD Pecan, and got a fist-bump from my waitress. It was a great choice, indeed."
43,47,1,2115,"This store is easy to find, in the mall near the front door,  close to parking.\nMore than that, great selection, good prices and friendly staff.  What more\ncould you ask for?"
10,12,1,6442,Great hotel!!  Love the Diamond Lounge!!
72,76,1,9073,"Mark was awesome in finding a time that he could fit us in so last minute.  He was even a little early for our appointment.  He did a great job, our carpets look almost new! His prices are very reasonable and when it comes to a reliable trustworthy businessman, I would recommend Mark!  We will definitely being using him again in the future!"
57,62,1,6716,"Nobou presents itself as Japanese tapas. The flavors were quite amazing - the portions, even for tapas, were quite small however. We ordered 6 plates and 2 beers and walked out with a $120 bill. It was quite a treat but the price was somewhat of a turn off."
395,445,1,5785,"First Hooters experience. Sure were a lot of boobs around the building, but sorry girls, your sets do not compare one of the girls in my party of 3. :)\n\nAll boobs aside, since I was a first timer, my girlfriends gave me a brief crash course of the menu and some recommendations. We started off with fried pickles for appetizers and 20 piece boneless chicken. Not knowing what kind of seasoning we want for our chicken, our Hooters girl was chill enough to allow us to do half and half on certain flavors to explore around. She recommended the Honey Thai seasoning and we chose the Cajun to seal the deal.\n\nOur fried pickles came out, fresh out of the fryer, and we dove right in. Too bad they only gave out one dinky cup of dipping sauce, which completely ran out halfway into our appetizer. They charge extra for extra sauce (oh come on, really?), but we still went ahead and requested some more. Our boneless chicken finally came and I like how each flavors were served in separate plates. The Cajun was spicy, yet tolerable, and indeed SALTY! I suppose that's how Cajun seasoning is supposed to be, but it was alright. The Honey Thai, recommended by our Hooters girl, was probably my favorite. It's sweet, with a hint of spiciness. I would like it if the spiciness was kicked up another notch, but our Cajun wings already covered that department, so it was all good. They were also a bit salty.\n\nOverall, it was a nice and SALTY experience. I think I chugged down 3 cups of water throughout the meal. Our Hooters girl was also nice enough to split our check three ways. She definitely got a nice tip from all of us.\n\nI want to give it 3.5, but had to round up because of the accommodating staff and clean atmosphere.\n\nWarning for those at risk for high blood pressure, this is where sodium dwells."
157,161,1,8964,"I had never heard of this place until a co-worker mentioned it a couple of weeks ago. I have been twice since. The pick two combo comes with a full sandwich and either soup or salad. Every meal includes a chocolate dipped strawberry. The staff is as friendly as they come and gets through a long line of lunch goers in a hurry. Your lunch will run you about ten bucks, with a beverage, if you opt for the combo. Their variety of sandwiches, soups and salads is sure to include something for everyone. You order and pay at the counter so there is no problem splitting the check or waiting around for the check if you are one of those who has a boss watching the clock to make sure you don't take an extra minute during your lunch break."
39,42,1,7802,"ordered by phone. the customer service rep was very knowledgeable and helpful. as for the food, well, dominos has always been my favorite. im glad they're now in my area."
134,162,1,88,"This is a great  stop for a meal if your going to a Bobcat's game or any event at Time Warner arena.\nThey have covered garage parking for just $5 and a menu that just won't quit. They've got something for everyone.\nTry the Mahi tacos, two fresh and flavorful,  crispy tacos, covered with a soft flour tortilla...the flavor screams at you...!\nIf it's busy, you can get a game of pool on the two billiard tables or sit at the bar and enjoy on of the many big screen plasmas. \nIt's a five mimute walk to the Bobcat's and the Blue Line Lynx with easy access stop to Panthers."
9,9,1,7389,Great Beer selection and decent food.
72,77,1,2165,"Amazing. Delicious. I eat way too much of it! They have Shiner Bock on tap, which is another plus. Yes, it's a wait, so go with a group of friends and order some pitchers while you wait. Or get take-out or delivery if you don't have time to be social. But don't miss the goodness."
54,57,1,2707,"A great place to get a burger they are fresh and tasty.  The burgers are hot and juicy also, the fries aw fresh cut and fried to order. It is a must stop for me when going to Vegas. Checkout their website for the secret menu options!"
16,17,1,131,"this place is solid,  you will never feel ripped off, ever."
98,108,1,4988,"From my experience of seeing Ricky Gervais' Fame tour here, I found the Festival Theatre to be satisfying place to watch his stand up show.\n\nOk, the bars are rammed at the intervals, but they always are in theatres.  The seating was fine with no obvious focus on comfort, but nonetheless didn't restrict the blood flow to my derriere after a the 2 hour performance. \n\nThe big glass facade is great too, adding to the grand style of the building."
87,103,1,9206,Great experience. Great flavors in the lamb burger (gambino's broken leg of lamb) and the Capone burger with fried egg and sriacha sauce was also delicious. Great bun as it's light and does not overtake. Be sure to get the brussel sprouts appetizer.   Looking forward to trying other items. The s'mores dessert was a nice finish. Also a great bar. Many beers on tap and whiskey selection but opted for the wine.
12,13,1,8020,Been here twice and both times have been good.
41,46,1,6647,"Food was really good!  Pizza was delicious.  Suicide Fries were great, not for the soft pallet for sure. Bar feel with good range of drinks.  Mostly a whiskey bar and not with cocktails."
52,59,1,5657,First time here recently. Great place! Friendly bartender with good recommendations for beer. Terrific happy hour as well. I had the Prosciutto and Peach Flatbread which was easily one of the best flatbreads I've ever had. Will definitely be back to this place!
26,31,1,8081,This place is awesome!! Friendly staff and treats that are to die for. I especially enjoyed their fruit and yogurt parfait!
152,173,1,5608,"This yogurt is as good as it gets. Plus, they are fair and reasonable to the consumer, with prices at 37\u00a2 per ounce which is OK in a day and age where cute little yogurt shops are opening and trying to get like 44\u00a2 per ounce. The store is always clean and fresh, and they have a wonderful selection of flavors, constantly changing. The staff is friendly and nice, and they offer a great variety of toppings. Their toppings bar is kept clean and cold, and is the best one in Phoenix. I'd like to request that the owners put up allergens warnings on their machines if the yogurt contains eggs or nuts. Updated Jan 2015: Still our favorite yogurt place. Great flavors, friendly staff. Nice going Yogurtland!"
24,29,1,543,"I love their mexican pizza!  Happy hour in the cantina has great deals, half off appetizers and drink specials."
80,93,1,647,"This place is amazing... had all of my pants hemmed here and they always did a fantastic job at VERY cheap prices. They knew me by name after a few visits, and even let me in a few times after closing. If I needed something back fast they were always accommodating. I even had a bridesmaid dress altered here and they did it for under $50 - can't complain at all!!!!"
78,85,1,9670,"I was so happy that Passion8 relocated to Elizabeth. I finally get to experience the flavors for myself. The new location is sleek and minimal, with lots of wood. Our meal was terrific. Delicious oysters, charcuterie to start, with the fish of the day and quail for our mains.  All included wonderful combinations of interesting flavors. We will definitely make this one of our regular places."
138,148,1,3181,"We were very hungry when we got to Vegas and wanted to have a descent meal so we decided to go to MGM since we were staying at Hooters across the street. I have always wanted to try Wolfgang puck and thought this is my chance. I have to say I made the right choice. The decor, the ambiance , the food and the service was so great. We got calamari to share which was good, not the absolute best but still very good. I loved the crab cakes. They were so delicious. And the service was really wonderful. Our server was very attentive. I would definitely go there again. Its a perfect place for lunch or even just a drink with appetizers."
39,42,1,3707,As always I get my favorite dishes. Mongolian Beef and Chicken lettuce wraps! Service was great. Friendly but a little forgetful. But it is all good. I am full and happy!
321,365,1,1155,"Equal parts old-fashioned soda shop, restaurant, bar, and hangout. The location is absolutely crucial here. Located in one of the more walkable parts of South End, Pike's is a gem with a hefty menu complete with plenty of sweets and southern treats.\n\nHaven't been to Pike's in quite some time and this was my first go for lunch. Decided to dine al fresco and enjoyed every second of it. This time 'round, didn't go for anything on the sweet side of things, but rather went for the lunch menu solely. \n\nStarted with the mozzarella sticks. Both myself and my dining counterpart were shocked that they weren't the \""""out of the bag\"""" variety. These appeared to be hand breaded with a higher quality cheese than typically served. Marinara was standard, but the mozz sticks themselves were great. They also weren't covered with the typical panko, moon dust, crappy breading like usual.\n\nWent with the buffalo chicken sandwich for my entree. Holy craaaaaap. Ditch the bun, eat a few of the house-made chips, and enjoy the chicken. Not only is this sucker lightly breaded and flavored well with the buffalo sauce, it's straight up baptized in the sauce. Swimming, rather. I'm usually not for a pool of sauce, but this stuff was fantastic. It acted as a nice residual dipping sauce for the remaining chips. \n\nService was friendly, outside was perfect for the present weather, prices are fair, walkability is always a plus. Find a parking space along Camden or near Atherton and you're good to go."
46,46,1,8438,"The best pizza in Vegas. If you like thick crust, you have to try the Metro thick crust. It is amazing. The only negative with this place is the price, but sometimes you get what you pay for."
175,201,1,3912,I stopped by around 2pm it wasn't very busy and the girls that worked there were very friendly and extremely helpful. I ordered a dozen cupcakes and became the cupcake fairy for the day. It was my day off so I spent my day dropping off cupcakes to my friends and family who haven't tried them yet. They fell in love with the cupcakes and finally understood what all the fuss is about. My favorite is the strawberry cupcake the frosting tastes like strawberry and the cake is similar to banana bread. I tried the peanut butter one and I almost barfed. I enjoy peanut butter in moderation but this was an overload. Unless you are obsessed with peanut butter I wouldn't recommend it. Black and white and marshmallow were also pretty tasty. I don't even really like sweets but I can't help but devour these cupcakes even though I always get a tummy ache after eating them :)
21,23,1,1056,Loved this place. The duck tacos were fantastic. Also I would highly recommend the messy sundae.
99,105,1,4081,"This is a great show!  The performers were amazingly talented, and it was very well choreographed.  If you are a huge Beatles fan, there are lots of subtle references to people and places.  I agree with previous reviewer to not purchase orchestra seats.  There are lots of aerial acts that are best seen from the balcony, and one act in particular I don't think you would be able to see at all from the orchestra.  All in all, well worth the money for an amazing show."
87,95,1,1954,"Rounding up here.  It's really a 3.5. The good is good but not top caliber Italian. I had the burrata. The lobster was minimal, the sauce was good but it became incredibly buttery after a few bites. I guess eat it in moderation. We also has the bone marrow for an appetizer and the sardines that accompanied it were very good. Overall super over priced for what it is. Service was friendly."
131,144,1,2848,"Took the mom and sister here for a cool down today and WOW! I had the Vesuvio, which had the ability to literally fill my mouth with flavor bursting from each little paddle full of goodness. Thankfully I chose the single scoop, because honestly it was so rich that I probably  would have gone in to an embarrassing moaning fest if there had been any more in my cup. Mom had the Light Mint Chip - a refreshing choice on such a hot summer day. Sister brazenly went for two scoops of Caffe Espresso paired with Chocolate.  Other than the much discussed PITA parking situation complements of LGO, there was not a single deterrent from the perfection of this experience."
31,34,1,8802,"Visites last night and it was superb.  Best sushi, great food and great personnel including all.  I'll come back next time I visit Montreal."
268,283,1,9021,"I went here for the first time today.  I liked that they were 50% cheaper then other places I've been to for the same services.  They are big and plenty of room, but I would highly recommend calling in for an appointment because when I went I was lucky enough to get seated right away, but a large group of people came in right after me.  It was at least a 45 min wait for some of those women.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the person who did my threading decided to remove my widows peak without asking me about it first.  I like my widows peak, I've had it for years, maybe people have one.  It gives me a heart shaped face which I like, and now when the hair grows back in that specific area it will be awkward, frizzy, and it won't fit back into my ponytail for a while, I'll need lots of hair gel to tame it.  If they would have asked me I would have told them no, which I now know for the future what to tell them.  But if would have been nice if they would have asked before they did it.\n\nOtherwise I liked the place a lot, very very affordable. I've never found a place as cheap as this anywhere else.  I'm overall happy."
314,346,1,36,"My mom called me so giddy on the phone today, I thought she was going to tell me she won the lottery.  No.  Her sofa from Gene Sane arrived.  It made her just as happy.  \n\nShe and I went to Gene Sane a few months ago and found fabric for a sofa and chair.  The fabric was not inexpensive.  Some of that they have is really beautiful designer fabric, some of it is not so special and I am convinced could be found elsewhere for less.  However, they did have excellent customer service throughout the entire upholstering process.  And my parents ended up getting two sofas and three chairs done there.\n\nMy parents live in Oakland in a condo building with a ridiculously small elevator.  Gene Sanes went above and beyond to make sure this extremely long sofa from my grandma would fit in the elevator at my parents' building.  They brought the sofa mid-upholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator.  That is such great customer service it is ridiculous.  It did fit, which is great, but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment.  This is the kind of stuff that high end places in NYC know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case, it was good to know they have the skills to do so.  They were also great with attention to detail of lining up all the stripes on all the cushions both front and back.  These are the kinds of things that make a big difference."
17,19,1,2178,This Is what every domed ball park should strive to be. Nuff said.
9,9,1,1373,Great people and even better food!
116,126,1,3428,"I had suffered with bad looking and poor fitting dentures for years. I was referred to Dr.Ladd and from the time I walked through the door, I was met by the most informative and friendliest staff I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Dr. Ladd was very thorough in walking me through all the options and procedures that were offered to me.I now have great fitting and awesome looking dentures! My experience with Dr. Ladd and his wonderful staff has been a pleasure.I now have some amazing new friends, and most of all----I have my smile back!"
55,62,1,7353,I love the Shellac Mani-Pedi....it lasted 3 weeks and no chipping. If my nails didn't grow so fast I would have been able to go a month.  Clean and nice experience.  I will keep going they got me in and out in no time.
56,68,1,3269,DELICIOUS FOOD! The service was wonderful.  We ordered the bbq and the servers helped us cook the food.  It was a great value for the amount of food they give you.  I loved the Chap Chae and the tofu soup was awesome too.  We'll definitely be back.
207,236,1,1142,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I grew up in Northern Virginia so technically I would be a \""""Yankee\""""  We did not have the pleasure of Bojangles up where I grew up, but I think it's slowly starting to make its way into VA.  Popeye's was my absolute favorite (and still is in some respects) but livin' in the south, I gotta give props to Boj's.  \n\nUnfortunately I've put myself on a diet, but I really really do enjoy Bojangles when I do get it - when people from out of town come in.  It's a great excuse to get some good chicken, biscuits, and sides.\n\nThis location is off Independence Blvd.  Unfortunately you can't get to it easily when you are traveling East - just make a U-turn and you are good, but getting back out (if you want to continue East) can be a little tricky.  Other than the logistics, the chicken is great... the staff is always friendly... and the place well kept."
32,38,1,4328,"Chicken burritttoooooo! Since this one is in the Marketplace, it's pretty much always busy. They are still good at getting you in and out though."
7,7,1,1691,Really good chocolate shake.
24,27,1,47,"Tram has great Pho, and enough of it to feed all of Pittsburgh when the next fake Armageddon rolls around."
85,89,1,9465,"I had a high end sofa and love that had seen better days. They were still very comfortable, so I thought I'd have them cleaned and conditioned. The company that came over to clean them said they were beyond repair. Leather Like New was recommended and both pieces now look good as new...I kid you not. It's unbelievable what they did to each piece. Thanks guys for an amazing and incredible job."
37,40,1,9404,Love this place. Amazing pizza and the best margarita's I've ever had! They're super fresh and definitely a cool spot to have a drink w friends on a patio.
57,59,1,6137,"Great service! Kimberly, our server, was prompt with our orders, she was very polite and courtious. The manager stopped by and checked on us twice. Everything tasted amazing. This was my boyfriends first time here and he was very impressed. Price was not bad at all!"
254,289,1,8553,"LOVED THIS PLACE!!\n\nI am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan and have been wanting to go to one of his restaurants. This is the firs one of his that I have been to and it was GREAT! We came on a Monday night around 9:45-10:00. They said the wait would be about 45 minutes but it surprisingly was only about 20! We got seated and we were greeted right away by our server Callie. She was excellent.\n\nAppetizers- we had the Jalapeno Poppers- definitely reccommend! The presentation of them was great as well as the taste and the ranch sauce that it was dipped in. They make their ranch with Sour Cream with was so good! We also got the Onion rings- very good too and the chipotle ketchup was quite delicious!\n\nBurgr's- I ordered the Britannia Burger it was sooooo good! The mango chutney sauce on it was delicious and the meat was cooked perfectly. The other favorite Burgr at the table was the Hells Kitchen Burgr- looked very good too!\n\nOverall a great restaurant, with great food and excellent service. I love the atmosphere and I am looking very forward to coming back again and to Gordon Ramsay's other restaurants in the future! Keep it up BURGR!!!"
60,68,1,6608,"Just arrived from the overnight train, arrived at Edinburgh Larder with our 3 suitcase and two tired children and the staff couldn't have been more welcoming.\nFood fabulous. Wholesome, nourishing, delicious & fresh. Tea/coffee great. Will be back and we're only in town 2 days!"
15,16,1,7044,Just signed up our 2 year old daughter and she loves it :)
112,126,1,5562,"I know that every time I walk here with Dexter, I will be met with a very robust greeting. I think the employees drink coffee. A lot of coffee. They are bouncy, but not obnoxious. They're just...happy.\nEvery drink I've had there is great! I mostly get an Americano on my morning walks. I've had a caramel drink there, too.\nThey always give Dexter a biscuit, which is a nice touch.\nI love their Social Media presence, too. They respond to pictures. I like that."
110,125,1,4447,"Karen,\nThank you so much for all your help in finding a temporary residency for my client!!\nI will always remember, in just few hours after providing you w/ a list of requirements my client desired, I had results of several properties to choose from!! This made the experience that much more exciting for my client and also helped elevate the additional stress of searching and finding the right location on their own.\nYou are truly wonderful at what you do!\nThank you again,\nChristopher Morales\nTechnical Recruiter- Impact Technology Recruiting."
10,11,1,1595,Can't go wrong with the cheese steak
30,30,1,8558,The burger was great! I got one with duck topping and it really popped! Stick with the sweet potato fries over any other type though.
6,6,1,7450,Big Delicious portions!
12,13,1,3501,Great selection of international treats. A little pricey.
80,84,1,1318,"You gotta love a good auto parts store that has the parts you need, on hand, for a cheap discounted price. I just picked up a fuel pump for my truck for $160, comparable to any of the big brand name stores for $220. Been coming here for the past few years as I've needed to, and they always have the parts I need on hand. excellent little shop."
161,168,1,3026,"I got the veggie pad Thai- it was out of this world good. The tofu was delicious and the meal was chock full of vegetables. I love that they ask you how hot you would prefer on a scale from 1 to 10. I got my dish at a 4 and it was just spicy enough to keep the burn without having to slow down to take a break from the heat or have my eyes water. If you like really spicy foods I would get higher but I would probably beware a 10! My waiter was awesome and was very quick and respectful, but the other guy in the restaurant was being a little sarcastic with the other patrons. I'm glad I didn't have him because I probably would have knocked a star. I would definitely come back if I can make it back to Vegas!"
55,62,1,4560,"Ahh so good. The line is pretty crazy and they could do to have more seating/a few larger tables, though. The croque Monsieur has a long cooking time, but is well worth it. The French lavender lemonade and the pastries are quick and SO delicious."
33,35,1,7883,"Terrific. The pizza is close enough to when I lived in Philly, and the flavored crust is great. The chicken is great, I tried the hot."
30,31,1,5396,"Still a fan, just need to put it out there that the dancing dragon roll is not so great :( BUT I still love Little Asia."
23,35,1,3007,Good food.  They have Oban scotch.  I had the gnochi after a bruschetta appetizer.  Service was good.
28,29,1,7433,"Good burgers at good prices. New place, clean and open air. Beer coming soon. Counter to watch big screen tv at."
140,156,1,9393,"This place is incredible and lives up to the hype. We went over the weekend at 2PM and we only had to wait about 15 minutes. The guy behind the counter chats it up with everyone and that's part of the reason there is a wait. They're efficient the the meat is amazing and he was handing out samples. We got a big side of potato salad, a small side of coleslaw, 2 cokes, one enormous piece of brisket that my gf couldn't finish and I got pulled pork and it came out to $50. I didn't eat again until like 9PM. The price may shock you, but for the amount of food it's worth it. Definitely the best BBQ around."
139,146,1,9536,"Now this is more like it! We had come to this busy little area of downtown to enjoy a drink somewhere, and we were a bit surprised by all of the security and the lines to get into places. We aren't the velvet rope type of people, and we don't generally dress up to get a drink somewhere. Rooftop 210 was just what we needed.\n\nIt's a laid back environment, games of cornhole being played on one side, and a number of benches and tables on the other for outdoor seating on a nice evening. The beer selection isn't great by any stretch, but they will probably have something to suit your tastes. Bartenders were busy but friendly."
72,75,1,4639,I really enjoyed this place but I wouldn't even bother going here unless you have a pass or you plan on getting there before 10:00.  I got in around 11:00 and the same people where still waiting to get when I left a couple hours later.  Once you get inside it's a lot of fun.  They played great dance music.
30,37,1,9161,As good as ever.  Today I had eel sashimi - I think.  It was delicious.  Also had a tuna roll.  Love this place.
110,134,1,9391,"This place is everything you want in a not just a bbq joint but a food establishment! I had the brisket sandwich,  turkey, pulled pork & jalape\u00f1o grits. I have never liked bbq in my life but I had never had bbq done right.  I live in la and this bbq surpassed any ive tried there. What sold me most was the first rate customer service!  The owner Scott, was so  accommodating & personal. He and his father came from behind the counter to check on us and show us the gigantic smoker. PERFECT PLACE!"
73,75,1,6778,"Ask for Josh Hernandez. I have been going to Josh with my families cars for over 5 years. It's hard to find someone who you can trust as a mechanic and when I found Josh I've stuck with him. I know I can count on him to take care of me, my wife or our 19 year old daughter with honest, friendly service."
137,158,1,2485,"Biaggis never disappoints. The food is always right on point, as is the service, and lots of yummy wines/martinis. The only issue is that Biaggis tends to be a smaller place with a huge following. On game nights, proms, graduations, and moms/dads weekends the restaurant becomes horribly packed and loud. The servers all do a great job to accommodate everyone. I'd recommend for the weekends such as graduation to make reservations months in advance. A nice perk is that Biaggis does rent out rooms. I love the outdoor seating in the summer too. I'm sad I only have 1 year left at U of I. Definitely will have to get my fill of Biaggis!"
87,92,1,7134,"Dr.Judge is amazing! He saves me time to time from painful headaches, and he is the first person I went to see when I threw my back out. There is no sales pitch, no bs... He is good at what he does and can relieve pain instantly. I sent a couple people there, and they were really grateful!\nPricing is good and walk in whenever you want. Membership is a no brainer!"
119,145,1,9560,"On my monthly trip around the state of Arizona I tend to stay in Goodyear once a month.  I keep finding my way back to Rudy's.  They don't advertise gluten free but do have a lot of choices for any allergies.  Ask at the front desk they have a laminated allergy menu,  including dairy,  soy,  gluten and sulfites too.  Food is great.   I have tried the ribs,  sausages,  brisket,  potato salad and the cole slaw.  They have real food and always fill me up.  I have never been disappointed here.   I love the Chandler location too.   Will happily return."
24,24,1,586,One of my favorite places to eat while in Phoenix. The service at this particular one is always great too.
172,197,1,4238,"Over the years I have been to Saddle Ranch many times for lunches, date night, or when family is in town and it is always a consistent and great meal for any occasion.  I've tried a bunch of their food and it is always good with HUGE portion sizes, I have never been home without a to-go box!!!! After almost every meal our table has been served a complementary 3 foot tall tower of Cotten Candy!! Very friendly staff!\n\nThe one meal I really miss that was recently removed from their menu was the Country Fried Steak. If owners are reading this review, please...please...pleassseee put it back on the menu! k thanks ;)\n\nAlso, if you have never taken a bull by the horns....or in this case a mechanical bull...you've got to ride the bull for some great country fun!!!"
178,189,1,4098,"Stayed here again because of the convenience to the light rail. My husband and I along with 2 friends had tickets to the George Strait concert and wanted to not have to fight traffic so we chose the Radisson. Check in was a breeze and the front desk clerk upgraded our rooms to Cabana suites...free of charge. Once again the room was extremely clean and had been recently updated. Brian down in the bar was great for happy hour..and he has a heavy pour. Check out the happy hour specials, they have a list of specialty martinis for $5. We love this location, sure it's off the beaten path and across the street from an adult bookstore but everyone is always friendly and pleasant and the property is taken care of and the best part it's 2 blocks from a light rail station. Catch it and enjoy a concert or sporting event downtown without the hassle or cost of parking."
41,50,1,8995,"Good service, very friendly staff. Oysters are delicious. I'd give a 5 star of they had more sauces or garnishing given other than lemon and tobasco sauce. But it's very yummy nonetheless!"
34,38,1,2885,Food was great - and I've just arrived from Spain! Busy but the service was very attentive! Cocktails are super strong- great value and fun Latin atmosphere.
26,27,1,2025,Last time I was there was for new years. It's a nice dive bar. They sometimes have a live band.
59,72,1,3023,"Great !!!! Ate there twice this week  . The veal Milanese was like my Grandmothers and the pastafagoile the best in town ! The Italian cake for desert was light and sweet , a great desert . I'm going back for more . The old school look is backed up by the authentic Italian cooking !!!!"
36,40,1,4246,"Spicy Seafood Pasta, yummy but spicy for me. Try it, you'll love this place. all fish served fresh than any other place. Manager is friendly and humble."
60,66,1,7856,"Our waiter Daniel was great!!  Side salads are not listed on menu but are $3.99. Buffalo chicken pizza was good. I ordered the Romania  chicken salad. The chicken was dried out,  but Daniel & the mgr were quick to bring out new chicken. Maybe stick to the pizza imo."
182,200,1,3094,"It's a lot nicer than the buses in the area in from, I'll give it that haha. The Deuce comes with nicer than usual bus drivers and even some attendants towards the front who help you get around. There are display screens and announcements that also make it clear as to where you should get on and off. It's double Decker, which we really loved, it gives you a nice view of the strip and makes you feel like you're on a tour haha. Its clean and nice looking. I recommend getting the 24 or even the 48 hour passes, it really makes it easy for you to get up and down the strip and over to Fremont St. My only gripe is that finding the ticket kiosks is confusing, they're not at every stop and the stops that they're at, they're not always visible, but overall I'm very glad that we had this as a transportation option :-)"
75,82,1,8916,"I don't understand all these negative reviews.  This place is bomb! I got tacos and chips here on my way out of the Palms, and even after my 20 minute drive home, the food was delish!  The carne asada in the tacos was tender and full of flavor and the .  I wish I lived closed to the hotel so I could eat here more often!"
255,358,1,6872,"SnOw OnO  is so ono!  The best shave ice I've had was in Hawaii, with all the imitators here in Vegas selling \""""shave ice\"""" that has the consistency of a snow cone: chunks of hard ice that doesn't allow the flavor syrups to seep in.  Marianne of SnOw Ono starts with a block of ice, and shaves it to a fresh snow-like consistency, which allows the syrups to soak into every bite and makes for a very pleasing consistency!\n\nSpeaking of syrups, there are plenty to choose from; 34 were listed on their menu today: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QOE93SXgKd8EsaUT-DaXhA?select=BooUS55rP6XFtxwKzPOgNA  There are several add ons that you can use to customize your shave ice, some free and some available for only an additional $0.50 or $1.00.  Today I went with a small Li Hing Mui with Li Hing Mui powder: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QOE93SXgKd8EsaUT-DaXhA?select=Gybt5eAcCrTM_VMPYnrD2w ; it was delicious!  Seriously, Marianne knows what she's doing (she's a self admitted shave ice addict, afterall!).  \n\nDefinitely a place to revisit.  Be on the lookout for SnOw OnO at the local farmers markets, especially Fresh52 every Sunday!"
278,293,1,9365,"This place is still as good as the last time I went to it.\n\nSo good, in fact, that we ended our night there both nights we were in Vegas. Sure, some of the performances were repeated. but we didn't care.\n\nI love the crazy wigged DJ they always have. The drink tickets this time were for a delicious vodka fruity drink they called The Devil Inside. It was awesome. And two drink tickets for each girl was great.\n\nThe first night we came in, we didn't have a promoter so we lied about our names on guest list because the front staff practically showed us the list. We got in no problem.\n\nThe second night we came much later, probably about 1 am. A promoter stopped us on the first story of the hotel and asked us if we were on the guest list, we weren't, so he led us up there and we got in under his name. Score.\n\nThe only bad thing about Rose Rabbit Lie for me is that the music is like old school mixed with EDM. I don't like old music very much. It's not as easy for me to dance to. So I was dancing a lot less here.\n\nBut overall, I really like Rose Rabbit Lie. We'll be coming here a lot more in the future too."
19,20,1,3467,The salon is professional  and luxurious. Stella S. Is incredibly sweet and amazingly talented!
39,40,1,2737,"Gina - the manager, great service. Food came out as expected for a few of us, one party did not like their fish with skin, so Eric, our server fixed it."
128,138,1,4309,"My friend Tom told me to go there. I didn't think it was gonna be as good as he said it would be, but man Im hooked on this place. The flavor in the food is so unique. The menu has such great variety. I had the Chimichanga Monday, Tuesday, I had the Ribs which were very good. Friday, I had the Beef Medallion with Chipotle Pasta, my Dad had the meatloaf. Their food is incredible. Anyone who doesn't give this place at least 4 stars, has no credibility when it comes to food. It is a 5 in my book. Can't wait to go again soon."
37,47,1,9597,"Really friendly servers and hostesses, love the decor and layout, food is good. Loved the siu mai sampler, the hot noodles are great, and LOVED the taiwanese shaved ice."
125,142,1,567,Really good food for the price you pay. I love their Yakisoba !!!!! Also I just love the little old man who works the front. He is always so happy and really does his best to make his customers happy.. \nThat's why I feel guilty giving this place only four stars.. But I'm giving them 4 stars because  I wish there was another person to help with taking orders and taking phone orders.. Usually it's pretty busy and the poor man is juggling everything in front so it could take awhile to order and get your food.\nTip- call in your order and just pick up! So much faster :)
104,113,1,7303,"It's tough to review this place. I once got the Norwegian Burger and never looked back. It is the only thing I order there. I have cravings for it. I can't even tell you what else is on the menu. The beef is not as flavorful as some other places like Clover Joes a few place down, but everything else they throw on it still makes this one of the best in my opinion.\nMaybe one day I'll branch out. It just doesn't seem like I need to."
8,8,1,4275,This place rocks the universe!
174,191,1,6504,"If I'm not mistaken Soyo was on dirty dinning sometime last year? Oh well I guess, since their food is pretty good. I came here with a party of 4 including myself, been hearing so many good things about them and so many check ins from all kinds of people. Our group ordered kalbi, bulgogi and 2 other beef dishes I can't remember and all of them were really good. I'm curious to try the other menu options. The inside is kinda weird, but I guess typical Korean? No mean infringe on their culture, but there were also Christmas lights around the restaurant? The service was pleasant and I did enjoy the overall experience probably making this one of my favorite Korean spots in town, too bad they don't do AYCE Korean BBQ, that would be awesome. I would highly suggest for the owner to do it cuz their meats are spectacular."
23,26,1,4354,Food is amazing and everyone is super friendly!! I dont know how they cook their chicken but its soooo good
57,70,1,8055,"Love their plain and Almond croissants.  Triple Chocolate cake was pretty good as well.  Palmier was delicious!   I also had a Nutella brioche.  It was not as good as other pastries that I had tried, so I give them 4 stars.  But over all I love this place :)"
23,23,1,6983,"Great location, great servers provide by Mai, thank you for the good deals. Definitely will come back!"
55,64,1,1864,"it was my second time around and i'm so happy my memory didn't fail my tastebuds. for all you san franciscans, it's a cha cha cha's-like restaurant kicked up some notches. more selection, fantastic sangria and great portions for a excellent price."
64,76,1,3956,"Funny how such an old, small, non-glamorous casino can get a solid 4 star rating.  Anyway, I only go to Bill's for two reasons:  Drai's Afterhours and The Victorian Room for some 24-Hour food.  Don't let the old casino look deceive you, this place is the bizness."
92,98,1,8517,"Rice Paper, a sister location, has it down. We are aware that both venues are owned by the same owner but this one need a little discipline. The spring rolls we loosely wrapped, filled with to much lettuce and the sause was good but runny. We will be back cause we live close but for now we will go back to 7th street for our fix.\nGave them another chance last night. Much better! So I added a star."
19,26,1,335,I really enjoy their bruchetta. Their brunch is really good and the mimosas are tasty.
79,84,1,8880,"I only stopped in to try the gelato and it was great! I got a berry flavor and tried a few others, all we're tasty with the right texture. Probably the closest you're going to get to Italy here in Charlotte.\nThe guys working the counters were so nice and even told us about the cute patio by the pond out back. Great customer service and great product!"
37,40,1,3658,"Our whole stay was excellent!\nFelt like we're at home. The two bedroom suite with kitchen, dining rm, laundry,  etc. Just completed what a family needs!"
57,68,1,4372,"Mr. Phipps NEVER disappoints! He has catered our family's holiday functions for the last couple of years (including this past Christmas Eve) and we just can't get enough! Love the ribs, love the fried pickles and okra, love the sweet tea! LOVE STACY'S!"
48,50,1,8926,Beer selection was great including both draft and bottle favorites of mine DVD new ones to try also. Location is close to lots if other attractions. Very walkable neighborhood. Friendly knowledgeable staff. Had live music also on my Friday night visit.
82,96,1,23,"Great bagels, sandwiches, soup, and coffee!\nMy favorites are the veg-out bagel sandwich, the bagel dog on onion, and their sour cream potato salad is so good too.\nIf you like all beef hotdogs, you should try the bagel dog. They wrap bagel around the dog. When they heat it up, the juice soaks into that chewy bagel and it is heaven.  Mmm."
97,105,1,9450,"I love this store. Not only are the owners and staff super nice and helpful, but they have a great product selection and the self wash is top notch. They use premium dog shampoos and conditioners, the tubs are huge and easy for our pooches to get into, and always so clean. I haven't had a chance to use their professional groomer, but all the dogs I have seen leave there have looked cute and happy. So glad a self wash is in our area."
37,37,1,2260,"If you want a burger the size of your face, this is the place to go. The food is great and the menu has many different options. I highly recommend it!"
138,157,1,5579,"Gorgeous facilities.  I have started getting my pedicures here a few months ago.  With the 30% locals discount it is not much more than the cheap-o places and is an all-over better experience.  The last time I went I got an 80 minute massage also.  The massage was excellent and the therapist really focused on my shoulders like I asked her to.  The only downside is that they booked my pedicure right after the massage so I did not really get to use the hot tub, sauna, etc. because I didn't want to ruin my pedicure.  I will ask for my appointments to be spread out next time.  TIP:  bring flask of vodka to spike cranberry juice with."
123,143,1,2464,"From the moment we arrived at Bouchon everything was perfect.  We were lucky to have been seated in James section, I would venture to say that James is among the best servers in Vegas. We started with the charcuterie and Foie Gras-both we're mind blowing!  Our mains included the salmon, short rib, and lamb.  It's impossible to capture the expert preparation and presentation of each dish, leave it to say each dish was savored and enjoyed.  Deserts included the Bouchon Brownies, Lemon tart and bread pudding.  If you're in Las Vegas, make dining at Bouchon a priority!  You won't be disappointed!"
24,26,1,1156,Fun place. Great view of downtown.  A lil tight on the parking. The french press coffee was fun...
97,111,1,5121,"It's the Grand Luxe - I love this place.  It's basically like the grimy diner of vegas.  You're not their expecting amazing food.  You go there to get food energy to go back to pounding drinks and gambling like a degenerate.\n\nThe salads are surprisingly good, otherwise you get the fried crap that you eat at TGIF or a diner.  It's not great, but certainly not bad.\n\n++ It's open later than other places."
7,9,1,1315,Amazing food nostalgic vibe delicious
26,32,1,1372,Food is definitely authentic & very good. Salsa was too watery for my liking & not very zingy. Burritos were HUGE!!!
24,26,1,6483,Flat out my favorite burger spot!  I didn't even used to eat burgers until this place entered my life.
37,43,1,2272,"Amazing sushi!  Only complaint was on one visit they brought my miso soup out after my rolls... it's typically a starter, so I'm thinking the waiter forgot about it."
14,15,1,5111,Best bar food in the neighborhood.  Staff is always good.
13,15,1,7142,for the price this mexican food is fast and on point
84,95,1,5908,"Been going to this practice for over 20 years.  Consistently great service from all, especially Sue & Rita at the front, Nan and Dr. Markham!  Always punctual!!  Dr. Markham even went so far as to replace a 2 year old filling at no charge, not because there was anything wrong with it but my teeth had moved and it needed to be built out.  You will not be disappointed.  Thanks guys."
47,51,1,8727,First timer staying here and have to say that their customer service at registration and the central bar was awesome!! They were super accommodating and made our first few moments at this hotel wonderful! What a lovely way to start a vacation.
111,131,1,9689,"Menu is a tex-mex hybrid featuring unique takes on nachos and Mexican fare.\n\nShared the bbq chicken nachos with the husband. The bbq flavor has a great sweet and savory combo with a slight chili powder dimension that is great to eat! The black beans, corn and white cheese go well with the succulent chicken. Although it was a great change to traditional nachos, we did miss the sour cream and guac you expect to find with nachos.\n\nWe will more than likely head back to another one of the Nacho Daddy locations."
95,111,1,2991,"Let me tell you something, disregard every other review here. This place is great, I have been here over 10x throughout my 3 trips to Vegas. This place has cheap authentic mexican food and I emphasize CHEAP & AUTHENTIC. Cheap as in breakfast starting at 4 bucks. They also have omelettes and huevos rancheros for 8$ with large portions that will FILL YOU UP. Great value, great taste, the other people here are insane. Definitely go here for breakfast/brunch."
48,54,1,2189,"Hippest coffee shop in the whole west coast. Amazing coffee, unbelievable ambiance and decor, great great customer service. Did I mention fantastic brews. Get the Atmosphere. Lux's iced coffee drinks do damage. Must visit even for tourists."
88,94,1,8246,"I fell in L-O-V-E with this shop the moment I walked in.  The layout, the decor, and the smells were captivating.  I had a wonderful sales associate who showed me to the sink and let me experience the magic of the scrub.  I chose the French Vanilla scent and I regret not buying the lotion too.  Fortunately, I have friends in Las Vegas who are willing to shop and ship for me."
35,40,1,2288,"Scones are outrageously good. So is the SCC. They have recently been experimenting with not calling your name\nout, which is a nice change, makes it quieter."
29,37,1,2420,"This place is fantastic. The food, the service, the location right in front of the Bellagio fountains. I cannnot reccomend it enough."
82,90,1,5503,"I really liked this restaurant..  It's fresh, a little on the trendy side. Casual enough just for a quick nice lunch or dinner out. I like to keep my carb count load down, so I do have eat around the menu. However it is a pizza and pasta place.. so what do you expect. Service was great, friendly .. I will definitely go back.\n\nfun time"
56,61,1,1253,"I started picking up books here for class, and began to really appreciate their other selections.  Certainly not a place to look for Sarah Palin's autobiography - plus one star for that.  They've also got a cool rack of zines and a bunch of bumper stickers as well."
267,298,1,2963,"Food: I heard so many great things about Tao so I had high expectations for the food. I ended up ordering the mongolian scallion chicken which was very tasty. I wish portions were a little bigger though. I also tried the squab lettuce cups which I loved! They have a nice selection on their menu and also daily specials.\n\nPrice: Prices here are expensive. My dish was about $27 or so and my appetizer was around $15, I think. You're really paying for the atmosphere.\n\nService: Service is outstanding here. We dined here early but there were plenty of waiters taking care of us. They were all polite, well mannered and very on top of their stuff.\nAlso you can make reservations on Opentable.com but if you are planning on dining on a Friday or Saturday night...make them at least a month or so in advance!\n\nAtmosphere: I loved it. We dined upstairs. Considering that we were here for an early dinner, it wasn't loud or anything. Very relaxing actually. I would love to see the night club next time. The entrance here is also beautiful. There are rose petal baths! I would love to come here to celebrate a birthday or something.\n\nLocation: Located right in the Venetian near the exit of the Venetian canal shops."
11,14,1,1222,The shrimp and grits were great...great atmosphere
152,165,1,2523,"Every time I come to Vegas, I visit Tao and am never disappointed.\n\nThis time my husband and I were celebrating my birthday and got bottle service in the hip hop room.\nWe had a great time!\n\nWhy 4 stars...\nWhen we arrived it took almost 20 min for the cocktail waitress to get our bottle of Hen and our mixers.\nOne of the drunk ass guys at the table next to us almost knocked down our bottle of Hen and did knock down one of our mixers all over the floor. Lucky for him not on my shoes!!!\nAnd the rope that was supposed to protect us and our alcohol... kept getting knocked down, people were trying to hop over, and there was no security in sight."
128,146,1,1512,"Martini Ranch has a live band downstairs and a DJ upstairs. We were there once during our Valentine's Day Bar crawl, and the second time during our 80's Bar crawl. \n\nRock Lobster rawked the stage during our 80's crawl. I was dressed like Peg Bundy in my leopard print top with belted waist. I played \""""cougar\"""" all night, dancing with lots of young, cute guys.\n\nThere's a large outdoor patio for the smokers and those who want to catch some fresh air. I loved the roominess of Martini Ranch. \n\nI will definitely return, especially when Rock Lobster is playing."
68,72,1,5532,What an amazing view of the Bellagio hotel. This restaurant is so nice and very romantic with its dimmed lights and wonderful view of the fountain.\n\nOur waiter was very nice and had tons of information to give us about every item we ordered. I enjoyed my meal here and the service was great. I will visit again.
52,55,1,7876,Food was delicious and the service was polite. I ordered the spicy beef and vegetable soup and it was wonderful. My husband enjoyed his beef fried rice and the dumpling appetizer was delicious! The side dishes were good as well. We will be returning soon!
30,34,1,1103,"Probably the best ice cream place I've been to. These guys have been hyped up by everybody, but it's all for good reason."
80,84,1,1880,So had lunch here with a colleague when we were passing each other going to two different conventions in Vegas. Food was good. Service was interesting. The servers were wonderful but the waitress was a little inattentive? Could of been just that it was slow and 2:30 so maybe they had cut staff. Enjoyed the lunch though and he picked up the bill! EDIT: The bread basket was great
56,67,1,3060,"Best new ballpark in MLB!!!  Took a tour on Monday, June 6th at 2PM.  Our tour guide was very informative, helpful, and nice.  Couldn't have asked for a better experience.  The team might not be great, but this ballpark is a MUST-SEE!!!!!"
26,30,1,4345,Great place to eat. Spinach and asiago dog is sooo good! Reuben was great too!! I will come here again.
18,18,1,7929,"Good food, friendly service, but the speed of service could use some work."
158,171,1,4031,"I LOVE YOU EARL OF SANDWICHES!!! My mouth is watering as I am writing this review, just remembering the taste of the sandwiches! I was in vegas last weekend and for that whole weekend, all I had was Earl's sandwiches! So far I tried The Tuna Melt, Earl's Club and Jerk Chicken sandwiches. ALL OH SO GOOD! My favorite I have to say was the Earl's Club. I totally want to try the other sandwiches when I come back, or better yet please make up in the bay area!!! I'd seriously come here everyday to eat. lol The wait was not that bad, and the workers there are extremely  friendly, even though i was probably drunk and obnoxious lol Sorry! Definitely a place yuo need to come visit if you are ever around in the area!"
280,303,1,6440,"I love this hotel because I somehow get complimentary upgrades a lot. I think it's my charm cause it can't be my good looks. LOL.\n\nFor the price, it's not a bad hotel with a solid location on the strip. Just make sure you request the North Tower (newer one). I stayed in the South Tower suite once and it was okay. The furniture was pretty old but the fact that I paid for a regular room and got a room 4 times the size with a bar, millions of couches, and a few TV's, I really could not complain.\n\nOnly 1 somewhat bad experience when I requested a non-smoking room and got a smoking room. Non-smoking should not be REQUEST. It should be standard. A king or 2 queen beds is a request. I can live with not sleeping with my girlfriend but I can't live with my face shoved in a pillow that smells like years of nicotine! But after a call downstairs, they moved me into the North Tower Executive Suite for a night free of charge. Holla! It had a mini work out room with a bike and those hand rails in case you want to be a ballerina I guess? \n\nPlus, the hotel connects to Paris so I don't have to walk outside. Yay!\n\nLow limit tables for those looking to just gamble for \""""fun\""""."
93,107,1,4148,"Great service, Great food and Great Beer. I had a Heff that was awesome. My server recommended a turkey burger stuffed with cheese, basil, and kalamata olives topped with feta cheese with pesto aioli. AWESOMENESS. The atmosphere in and outside of the restaurant is great. Local shops are very cool and there is outdoor seating with a outdoor bar. The burger was $11 the beer was about $4. I liked it very much and will for sure go back again."
121,146,1,3708,"their adobo fried rice, wrapped in a thinly scrambled omelette stype crepe is the bomb!! don't leave vegas without at least trying this. it's too good to miss out on!\n\nupdate: their adobo fried rice omlette is SUPER bomb! i had it for brunch today. i tore that sucker up. it was a friendly $6.95, and easy to share with my new hubby Walter. the girls who worked there were awesome too, real laid back. LOVE IT!! also, they have a new STUDENT special now. it's like $5 for a teri chicken plate. YUMM!"
109,115,1,8177,"If your ever in Scottsdale you must try this hip and colorful breakfast spot.  The food is excellent with many unique choices and surprisingly if your in the mood for a lunch time drink they have great mixed drinks. The only downfall may be a few of the waitresses fall short on superb service but my family found one server that is head and shoulders above all others so be sure to request a server named Briana who makes us feel like we are exclusively catered too. Overall you surely will not be disappointed with the food, service, and vibrant atmosphere."
119,122,1,286,"A friend from out of town wanted to eat there so a group of us went here last night. When we got there there was a table open and we were seated immediately but there was a line outside while we were eating. The food was very good, everyone liked it. It was not the best I have ever eaten but still very good. The portions were not large but enough I didn't leave hungry either. Service was reasonable but not great. Considering this is a fairly small place and it was extremely busy I cannot complain. Overall it was a good experiance and we left happy."
84,89,1,733,Found this great place near my house! The dinning area is a little small but the food makes up for it! The staff was very friendly and pricing was not bad at all for the portions we were given. My husband and I both got a combo plate and each a small drink and it was only about $22. But they do have they same combos avialable for lunch special pricing. We will definitely be back!
79,84,1,4574,"This is truly the best Mexican food I've ever had--high quality dishes with fresh ingredients.  They served large portions at a ridiculously reasonable cost, and I've never had such good service from the staff there.  They went out of their way to serve me with style.  Even though I have family in. Charlotte, I might have to come back here just to come to Las Margaritas!"
70,84,1,4549,"I truly enjoyed my experience at Tandoor. The staff was super friendly, the flavors were both fresh and savory. You must order the Samosa's and  garlic naan to start. My curry chicken was also very satisfying. \nI betcha didn't know they have free WiFi! ;) So get cozy and stay awhile! Don't forget, it's BYOB."
136,148,1,6945,"This place is awesomeness in its entirety, minus it's tucked away. That could be a good thing though. The decor is delightful (pics to follow) and the staff is wonderful! Usually they have a wait but today people must be bbqing. One thing that stands out\nabout this cafe as opposed to others is that it's family owned & run and they wear pajamas while serving you. Love it! Riley was a fantastic server. She was helpful with suggestions and a joy to have. I'm a fan, this place is consistently on point. If you're in the southwest side of town, you must give them a try. Definitely in Vegas' top brunch spots!"
168,182,1,6820,"I was pleasantly surprised when I used Blue Sky for some recent trips because I wasn't sure how quickly they would be able to get me back and forth from the terminal.  There are a few off airport parking companies but this one is conveniently located right off of the 143 & University.\n\nSky Harbor has made some drastic changes to their economy parking and it took way too long for me to get back and forth.  They send the shuttle over to your parking spot directly so you don't even need to work about hauling your luggage to a predetermined pick up spot.  Don't even both with going to the terminal because Blue Sky makes it fast, convenient, and has great discounts.\n\nIf you book your space online you are able to get a discount and check your Valpak mailers as they have coupons in there as well."
24,28,1,8597,Rolling belt of sushi. Lunch time each dish 1-3 dollars. Awesome! Try the baked Scallop Cali Rolls
103,112,1,563,The best sushi in Chandler. Possibly in the Phoenix metro area.\n\nShimogamo is a quiet sushi location in a strip mall.  The interior has just a few tables and is very peaceful.  Hurry is not the name of the game here; bring a friend that you really like and have some great conversation while you enjoy the easy going but very pleasant service.\n\nYou won't taste ice on your fish here and it's one of the few places I feel comfortable eating sushi in the desert.
226,266,1,9506,"Let me start off by saying I am a huge taco fan!  So when I tell you that the tacos here are some of the best tacos I've ever had, that really means something. I've been here multiple times and tried almost all the tacos so far, my favorites are the al pastor and the veggie. The al pastor is so flavorful with little chunks of pineapple on top... And you might think I'm crazy when I say the veggie taco is one of my favorites, most people like meat in their tacos, but this veggie taco is so tasty! Mashed potato in place of meat, mushrooms and what ever else veggies it has, perfect... It might just turn me vegetarian! Jk but it is very good. I'm not a beer fan at all, so I can't comment on the beers, but the cocktails I've had are the Dirty South Andy (kinda like a Moscow mule with little tweaks) and House Margarita (it has \""""salt air\"""" instead of salted rim which is pretty unique and cool!). This place is pretty new still but I think once the word gets around it will be pretty popular!"
112,123,1,4467,"Review for take out. Went here twice for take out. Wanted to order food and take it to Freedom Park for a picnic.\n\nReason selected Pio Pio was the name which reminds me of the Pio Pio in Jackson Heights, Queens. The best for Peruvian food with a pitcher of Sangria and live music at night.\n\nWe ordered 1/2 chicken with plantains, rice and beans. Chicken was cooked to perfection each time. My favorite is definitely the plantains.\n\nWill have to stop by for dinner the next time."
216,245,1,1453,"First time customer, glad I tried them!  Not knowing what their pizza would be like and the fact that they served by the slice made my decision easy.  I ordered 2 slices to start with, one had bacon, tomatoe, mushroom and onions and the other had meatballs, peperoni and tomatoes.  They were excellent, the crust was thin but not like a cracker, had a nice chewiness to it with a bit of crunch.  Nice home made sauce, not sweet like some or too spicy like others.  My wife says she has found a new pizza place and I'm sure we will be regulars.  Our third slice had meatballs, anchovy and tomatoes.  We were amazed at the quantity and quality of the toppings.  Of all the toppings, the meatball was our favorite.  The slice comes off of a 24 inch pizza so it is plenty to eat at $2.25 a slice and 35 cents per topping.  They make one great NY style pizza!!!  On each table there was parmesan cheese, oregano, red peper flakes, garlic salt and salt and pepper.  Can't wait to go back."
4,5,1,169,Decent!
394,426,1,267,"I finally got around to coming here last night, and I really like it!  I knew what I was getting into because A) I've been to the original wineburger at 19th ave and Bethany Home already, B) I've read the reviews and C) I knew that these two places were originally started by a pair of brothers many years ago.\n\nWalking in, its a real divey type place.  Wood paneling on the walls, simple no frill tables and chairs, with limited decorations and dimly lit.  It's set up exactly like its sister location the original wineburger, with half of it being a bar with chairs and tables, and the other half being a pool and congregating area for those that want to do more then sit and hang on the bar.  I also saw a pinball machine, which was pretty cool as well.\n\nThey have a few TV's hanging from the walls behind the bar with a variety of sporting events on for you to watch. Granted, I'm not a huge sports fan, but it's better then staring off into space or what not.  I sat at the bar, since I felt more comfortable there, and there wasn't to many people in here, so there was more then enough seating for me. I felt really comfortable here, and didn't feel like being around a million people anyways.\n\nThey have great beer and alcohol specials during happy hour, and they have a decent menu of items to choose from. Prices are great, and the bartender here was really super cool.  Him and I chatted throughout my meal and I really enjoyed the conversation.  I went with the Jumbo Hot dog, and it was tasty...charbroiled and all, I really liked it here.\n\nIf you want a low key night out, go check this place out. Divey, dark and not half bad. Will be back in the future. I think I like it here better then I did at the original one."
294,308,1,5857,"I have been to this location 3 times for lunch and dinner in addition to the original in Brooklyn. My expectations of a restaurant start with how long it takes to get seated, how long it takes before we are greeted by our waitress, how long it takes to get our food and if our waitress follows up with how are meal is and if are drinks are full. In my opinion, Grimaldi's surpasses all expectations.\nThis particular restaurant is great and this is why.\n\n1. Staff was prompt and friendly\n2. Food is amazing and love the decor\n3. Management came to our table on more than one occasion to see if we were   enjoying our food and if we needed anything. It had a family feel as if your grandmother was making sure you were taken care of.\n\nMy wife and I get our pizza with pepperoni and extra basil, it is simply fantastic but the plain cheese and basil is more that satisfactory. get the large, it is only $2 more. We make sure to go here every time we visit Las Vegas. One last thing that made me enjoy this restaurant even more. There was an older couple next to us that looked as if they were from Duck Dynasty or some other hillbilly lifestyle. They were basically old school Vegas and I thought it was fantastic that this nice restaurant was a place of diversity where you can see a redneck, someone in a suit or a family. Great food is for all to enjoy."
12,12,1,5893,Good breakfast place if you are in the area.
311,336,1,315,"Ice House Tavern is a dive bar with character.\n\nBehind the bar is a large plexiglass wall with the Arcadia ice rink on the other side. The coolness of this is that you can sit at the bar and watch hockey or ice-skating while you drink. When we first arrived, there was a hockey game in mid-swing. There were multiple occurrences of goal shots gone wide, with a final destination of smacking against the back of the plexiglass bar wall near us. I found this to be highly entertaining, but it could definitely cause some people to get startled, so you might not want to sit directly at the bar if there is a hockey game on-going and you are easily spooked.\n\nThey've got darts, video games, plenty of seating and a good bottled beer selection. I wish they had a good micro-brew on tap, but alas, I settled for the bottle route. Thankfully, they've got some awesome bottled beers, like the 22 oz Arrogant Bastard Ale from Stone Brewery and Kiltlifter from Four Peaks.\n\nCool (literally) & unique dive bar. Check it out and then test your luck out on the ice.\n\nP.S. The place can be a bit difficult to find if you don't know where it is. Drive to the left of Wal-mart and into the back alley area, passing Arcadia Ice Rink & then make a left. You'll see banners at the top of the end of the first building. That's the spot. Enter on the side."
36,41,1,8585,It's really good food. The crazy potato is the best thing on the menu. The Carne Asada  has been dry at times but not enough to detract from the overall.
189,214,1,7974,"I don't usually write reviews of chains this large, but I had to mention this place.  I came to Venetian late in the morning, close to 10 AM.  But, I wanted breakfast.  Looked through the choices at the food court on the 2nd floor and was underwhelmed.  Decided to try chicken and waffles at this place.  Very glad I did.  You got 2 enormous waffles and 3 thick chicken strips for $12.99.  The chicken was breast pieces and was clearly not formed.  The breading is crispy but not greasy or overly thick.  While the chicken was great with the waffles, I preferred it more with the spicy grandma sauce.  I don't know what's in this stuff, but I wish they would bottle and sell it so I can put it on everything.  Highly recommended, and although the price is high, you got a lot of food for the money.  And, it's the Strip, it's par for the course."
199,227,1,245,"It has been a good year or two since I have eaten here last and I'm not sure why. Today reinforced how much I like this place. To me, Qdoba falls into the Chipotle category although I feel the portions are definitely more generous than Chipotle. I like to get the Naked Chicken Burrito which is essentially a burrito with no tortilla. So, basically the Chipotle burrito bowl. It is just under $6 and enough for two meals. I'll instantly halve it when I get home to prevent me from overeating. It is very good. Their guacamole is very good, too. They also have a pick 2 combo for $6 and gives you smaller portions of your choice of the naked burrito, mexican soup, tacos, cheese quesadilla, etc. The other thing I like about this place is the rewards program and also how nice the employees always are. Like I said, it has been a long time since I have been back and I always comment on how friendly the employees are. Good sign."
30,39,1,1737,I love Ninos......I feel it's authentic Mexican and I am hooked on their Chili Relanos.  I stop for lunch every chance I get.
46,55,1,8868,all the employees are incredibly helpful and friendly. Awesome soups salads and sandwiches- like panera x1000. Each entree comes with a chocolate covered strawberry. Italian sodas with flavorings! Desserts! A great little lunch spot. Love it here
31,36,1,50,"Comfortable, friendly, affordable.  Nice stop before an evening out.  I need to head there primetime to assess the evening vibe.  Will be back."
75,81,1,5417,"WiFi password is really complicated.\n\nThis is a cool place to get something different for lunch.  They have all kinds of different pitas and usually have some kind of promotional pita as well.  If you want to sit and eat there, make sure you do not go right at lunch time as seating is limited and it will be very hard to find a place."
32,37,1,5155,Really really the best pedi ever! Pho was so attentive and didn't rush me at all! Every time I come to Vegas I am coming here!

47,52,1,6663,"We stopped in here randomly for some wine and appetizers. We can a great, reasonably priced reisling, and decent cheese and pork terrine. Very cute place to have a glass of wine on st. denise. Also pretty reasonable."
159,167,1,5697,"I've heard lots and lots about In-N-Out! So when we finally made it out to the west coast, I told my husband that I was not leaving until I had had an In-N-Out burger. And let me tell you, they are worth all that fuss. I was a little shocked at the limited menu they have, but it didn't affect me in any way. I knew I was going to get the Double-Double Animal Style thanks to all the reviews I'd read. It was hot, and cheesy, and amazing. My husband had a hamburger, and it was really tasty and flavorful too, much to my surprise. Why are they not a country-wide chain yet? Come on In-N-Out, get to Michigan quicker!!"
51,58,1,3693,Clean theaters and bathrooms with many movie options to choose from.\n\nDo park on the West side of Red Rock Casino as the theater is quite far from the East parking garage.\n\nEnjoyed the movie Interatellar on IMAX with family.
56,56,1,4374,"Great place to take in a baseball game. The times that I came here there were no concession stands but knowing that ahead of time was perfect, so it provided ample opportunity to run to the store to buy stuff or go somewhere or plan to go somewhere after the game."
63,73,1,1355,"Real Mexican food. The tortas are wonderful and reasonably priced. If you have not had a Mexican sandwich before, let me introduce you to The Torta. Carne asada, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, avocado, on a soft roll. No mustard or mayo. Yummy and a $4.99 a filling lunch."
39,45,1,2766,Little Saigon is the best Vietnamese food I've had in the Phoenix area.  The restaurant is family owned and the food is great.  I suggest the Rice Vermicelli with grilled pork and shrimp.
30,31,1,5426,A great place in the m resort to grab a quick bite for breakfast or lunch ask for a comp cause its always better when its free!
55,60,1,5067,Another decent Pho place in the greater Phoenix area. This one is very clean and nicely decorated.  Staff is very friendly.  Pho and spring rolls are delicious. Price is a little more expensive compared to other pho places. But you do get a lot of food here.
25,30,1,3017,"Good food, good ambiance, excellent service.  Make sure you get the Nove Gnocchi for one of the side dishes!"
28,34,1,8766,Jeff is amazing with a very reasonable price. If you need a locksmith I gurantee you jeff wont let you down!!! Excellent service.
132,154,1,8921,"Finally got around to visiting this place and it was better than expected. Saturday night and the place was full - for good reason. Nice fresh blue point oysters on the half shell, steamed clams ( steamed in broth which was almost better than the clams!). Fish ceviche - tasty, fresh - actually got one to go. Tamale del Mar with pablanos - didn't overwhelm the seafood. All the sides - slaw, beans, rice weren't swimming in whatever sauce which made them stand out for their own taste. Definitely will revisit - have to try the tacos next time! Don't know why we didn't but all the other items looked great and were great."
89,99,1,6831,"Perfect lazy summer evening ice cream shop.  Love the old fashioned soda jerk counter (as a former junior member of the Nat'l Assoc of Soda Jerks, I'm obviously an expert! :P ) and classic ice cream sodas, although I remain a total sucker for the vanilla malt.\n\nI have no experience with the bait shop, but they appear to have 5-7 worm varieties to choose from, so... there's that!"
86,99,1,8262,"I am definitely a fan! Although we waited a while, it was worth the wait! So many different kinds of foods, and everything I had tasted good! Definitely tastier than your typical mass produced buffet food. It's very clean and pretty organized. We went for brunch, and the buffet came with bottomless mimosas! I'm excited to go back the next time I'm in vegas...it's definitely a must try!"
228,249,1,7588,"This is the second time coming to Genghis Grill and to tell you the true I was a little skeptical in going in again because the service the first time at the Tempe Market where waitresses and waiters were very indiferent to even check periodically or ask if we needed. Anything else also it took a while to get. A re fill on a glass of my iced tea which I set in purppose at the edge of the table empty while staff kept going by acting like it they were very busy also we waited a long time to get our check, the food was good overall\nMy experience at the Frank Lloyd Wright location was very much rewarding and pleasant the staff was very joyfull and attentive to detail,from the moment we enter the door we were welcome and seated promply by the host and told that Tony will be our waiter which he did an amazing job starting by introducing himself and accomodating us with anything we needed our glasses of iced tea were NEVER empty and check on us in a timely matter I end up taking food home and a container for my iced tea provided by Tony over all service was EXCELLENT Tony you are awesome we will be back again for sure."
53,60,1,9511,"Excellent lunch today.  Our first visit to Bravo ever and will be back.  The rattelle with sausage was very good and the Pasta Bravo was tasty.  Sweet tea was sweet and light,  not to heavy.  We will definitely be back to see our waiter Ben."
56,59,1,447,"Loved this date, the food was pretty much what I anticipated as a fondue fan. I was floored however by their extensive dessert menu, where the flaming turtle using dark chocolate was the highlight of the meal. It will be in the potential date night rotation in the future."
49,56,1,8420,Really great wait staff. Chef very accommodating for gluten-free. Loved the red snapper. Kinda in a shopping mall. We tried lots of funky micro-brews. They have quite the list. Really liked the vibe and service here.
51,58,1,1441,"I have heard wonderful things about Sushi Kee for some time now. We finally made our way in and we were not disappointed. We ordered the edamame, shrimp tempura and the murphy roll. All items were very flavorful and something we would order again."
24,27,1,4606,Excellent and friendly service and best breakfast burrito and salsa ever. Humongous. Nice atmosphere too. Love this place.
25,28,1,8027,Starbucks makes everyday better!!! The staff is always very nice and they are super fast if you're in a hurry!
31,31,1,908,This place is good every once in a while. The servers are easy to talk too not much into customer service but its still cheap I think.
143,155,1,9251,"Decided to switch up my regular spot for a while and give Jimmy and his retro decorated barbershop a few tries. I love the old school vibe, tv and machines and cool car-barber chair for the kiddos needing a chop. While I thought he did a decent job on my haircut I doubt I'll be back. I asked for a razor skin fade twice on two separate occasions and Jimmy still left some hair where there shouldn't have been. Ah well it seems like he's doing a bang up job with the other fellows on here so I'm not worried about him losing one guy. In the meantime I'll still continue to go to my regular spot in Hendertucky. 3.5 stars, rounding up."
98,108,1,4161,"Great, fresh sushi at reasonable prices. All you can eat dinner for $26, plus free dessert to complete the meal. Only downsides to the AYCE is that 1) it doesn't include sashimi, and 2) if you don't finish everything you pay the $26 plus a charge for any remaining rolls. However, if you have one or two you that just can't handle they'll usually cut you slack. Service is decent and friendly. Overall a great hidden gem everyone should try."
23,24,1,6765,Best tacos for your buck hands down but be aggressive  seating is limited due to how many people are there.
12,12,1,3429,The staff was amazing at our Autism Walk meeting.
15,17,1,6730,I adore the staff at this place!! Great food as well.
8,12,1,5411,Bons burgers. Salle sympa.
73,75,1,318,"I was lucky enough to get two tickets to the opening night of Giselle. What a beautiful performance. The scenery was beautiful, the dancers were great, the story was easy to follow for those of us who don't have training, overall it was amazing. This production made me want to go to the ballet again and again! Very professional and very entertaining."
440,482,1,7055,"This is my most favorite buffet in Vegas and I prefer this over the buffet at Wynn hands down! Wicked Spoon is located in the Cosmo hotel and you will probably recognize this place because everyone loves taking photos in the life sized heels that are around the buffet.\n\nI came here for lunch and it was about $40 for lunch. It was a little cheaper than the Wynn buffet but if you want to go more all out, you can get bottomless mimosas for $9 more. I dont know why you would do that if you are already going to stuff yourself with allll those other items. Lunch closes at 3pm on the weekends and dinner starts at 5pm so you cant really linger so you can get the best of both worlds, unless you plan on staying for 4 hours at this place haha. The wait was longer than Wynn and it took us about 40 minutes to get to the front and finally sit down. It is beautiful inside as well and the chairs are comfy. I like the Wynn decorations better though.\n\nThe food is sooo delicious. There is so much variety but I really liked their tacos and their meat. I can describe all the food that they have but looking through photos will give you a better idea. I absolutely LOVEEEEE their dessert selection. They have so many desserts, cakes, macarons, GELATOOOO, tarts, chocolate covered strawberries, and sooo much more. Surprisingly my most favorite item was the yogurt and blueberries in a cup made out of chocolate. I can literally eat everything! I felt like Willy Wonka when he drank the tea and bit into the cup in the field of candy. I probably ate 5 of those. I ended up just asking if they can just give me blueberries and they were more than happy to give it to me. The desserts and food here are just so much better than Wynn and next time I go to vegas, I am just gonna head straight here :)\n\n**TIPS**\n1) Save room for dessert! The selection is wonderfully delicious!\n2) Food coma will hit you bad. Along with lack of sleep, the food coma knocked one of my friends out at the table. It was pretty hilarious.\n3) Enjoy!!!"
100,106,1,1071,"has a lot of variety of dim sum if you go early. One thing i hate about this place and prevent me from giving it a 5 stars because those ladies who pushed the carts, they're so pushy in trying to put food on your table, there are a lot of things i don't like to eat, and they just placed those plates on my table even though i said i don't want its. Give me time to pick out the dishes i want to order, will ya???"
53,54,1,2191,"Great place to get some work done, or go meet up with friends. I love the food they serve, and I highly recommend their brownies. On the down side, it tends to get a little bit too crowded. Definitely a place to check out!"
68,81,1,5610,"Okay - I have been in alot of Targets and Walmarts.  This store is absolutly the best.  The employees actually seem to enjoy being at work and smile and joke around.  You rarley have to wait in line for a register and the store is CLEAN.  Not sure about prices, I dont think they are that much higher than Walmart."
65,73,1,4355,They warn their food is highly addictive and they're not joking!\n\nI usually get the Teriyaki Chicken / Spicy Chicken Plate with steamed white rice and macaroni salad.\n\nI've been eating here for the past 2 years and I've never had a single time when I was disappointed with their food.
54,57,1,6916,"Awesome.  I was a bit skeptical, but the food was delicious, fresh and hot.  The crab legs were great, unfortunately, they never had enough out and people where waiting by the crab dish like they were starving.  They have a great selection of food."
38,44,1,6676,"Best place ever  to spoil your hands and feet!   Great location, great nail techs and great conversation!   They have amazing colors to choose from and know all the up to date trends!"
47,61,1,6750,Perfect size brown rice broccoli bowl was sooo good.    Chicken and steak better than fast food places...   Plus the Customer service is amazing.  They member your name and bring it to your table.    PLEASE TIP THEM!!!    I'll be back
161,175,1,4516,"My fianc\u00e9 and I have loved Sammy's and me in particular since they have great gluten free pizzas but when I decided to throw a surprise party there, they really blew me away with how helpful they were. I had to plan the party from the other side of the world  since I am deployed and their GM Julie was so incredibly helpful. They allowed me to pre order the food and pay for it as well as write a special message on a pizza for me! The let my friend drop off a cake a couple hours before the dinner and stored it for us. Everyone who came to the party said it was a wonderful experience and I know that is because of the great staff that works here!!  I cannot wait to get home and  have some Sammy's pizza!! (And the amazing quinoa salad)"
54,62,1,4657,I came here several times while visiting Montreal because it was so close to where I was staying at the McGil residence halls. The abundant seating and free WiFi made it a great place to sit and journal or write emails. Great mochas and scrumptious pastries/baked goods!
52,54,1,1965,"Brought my Swatch in for a band repair. They cleaned the face and I bought a new watch for my wife as well. The people were awesome, helpful and it was the best customer service I have had in a long time. Love this place."
41,43,1,6846,burgers were amazing and our waitress was so nice. there was a beer pong place inside and a bull it was awesome to hang out and its very laid back and chill for being on the strip.
42,47,1,4705,Caught in the rain!! We stumbled in here and had a coffee and a lemon tart.  Yum!!  Service was great and we were del get a table.  Didn't eat but the food looked good.
69,81,1,5168,"Overall Inn n Out never disappoints. The burgers are delicious, fresh and the cheese always perfectly melted. The lettuce has a crunch and the tomatoes aren't mealy. Things you would think would be expected of most places that serve burgers, but often these goals aren't met - except for Inn n Out. Quality burgers. All the time."
414,484,1,2748,"Shhhhhh!  Don't tell my friends but one of the hottest guys in the show was gay.  I didn't realize this until he realized I was gay and offered me his lap to sit on for the picture.  There's nothing really telling about the moment.  It was just a feeling.\n\nAs I sat on his muscular legs, I was like \""""umm...this Jaymes Vaughan fellow is such a sweetie pie.\""""  Then it hit me, he's most likely a southern gay.\n\nHe was a great emcee, full of charisma, warmth, and humor.  Not that a straight guy can't be those things.  But...yeah.\n\nAnd he was hot, way hotter than his pictures--which captures his body beautifully but not his face.  That's a good thing.  Why wouldn't you want the performers to be better looking live for a live show.\n\nPleasant surprise.\n\nAnd at the end of the show, he gave me a shout-out for being the only guy in the audience and said I would totally get laid that night by one of my three female companions.  Awkward heteronormative moment but not in the annoying way.  My friends got a chuckle because they knew better.\n\nI thought this show was going to be so cheesy and homophobic but it's quite gay-friendly.  Audience friendly in general.\n\nNothing trashy.  \n\nVery suggestive.  \n\nAnd lots of great naked butts.\n\nReally great.  \n\nExpect women to go crazy.\n\nReally crazy.\n\nIf Chippendales is something you're thinking of going to see, you really just should!  Put this expected Vegas experience on your list and cross it off.  I didn't necessarily find all the performers hot, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nDoesn't matter if the dancers are straight or gay, it's fantasy.  I've always been a fan of thinking.\n\nThanks Kristin for hooking us Yelpers up with a deal for the Yelp Spring Break."
69,74,1,8963,"To my horror we purchased furniture on Craigslist & there were bed bugs in the recliner. Luckily after calling several pest control companies & receiving estimates & inspections, I called Senske. Their service personnel was very knowledgeable & helpful. It took several weeks & repetitive treatments but my problem is solved. I would highly recommend this company. Thank you Eric."
136,143,1,2002,"We love a children's dentist... They have a very friendly staff and they truly seem to cater to the child. They have an awesome waiting area that is huge! There are a variety of video games, tv's,board games and even magazines to entertain the children before their appointment. The bench seating is probably the most comfortable seating that I have ever seen in a waiting area.\nThe exam room even has a very cool salt water fish tank for the kids to enjoy.\n\n The bottom line is that my girls don't seem bothered by coming here to see Dr. Saxe and have there teeth maintained. Isn't that the most important factor of all?"
9,11,1,274,The margaritas wont do ya dirty!
20,28,1,2215,The Khoa soi braised short rib was awesome!!! Get there at 515p or make reservations early!
13,16,1,4985,Great as ever! I recommend the nutty professor milkshake.
65,69,1,5340,Best buffet I have ever been to!! We'll worth the $40 person. All you can drink beer and wine and my boyfriend loved that. The food was excellent. Tons of variety and every type of meat u can imagine. The crab legs and shrimp we're delicious! Highly recommend and I will definitely be going back
20,20,1,2455,Amazing food! Perfect service! Great atmosphere! This place is as good as it gets!
181,195,1,3677,"I hadn't been to a Sonic at all in my life. I passed by this place in 2009 but now I can say I finally tried it.  It is near the Palms Casino, had the All American Hot Dog and the Coney Island Hot Dog w/ chilli and cheese. It definitely hit the spot at 3:45 in the morning or so.  Even if you walk up and order you can't physically go inside the restaurant, you order from the outside box and the people come to you with your order and you pay cash or credit.  The drink was cool too, the ice was chipped in a different kind of way, so the Sprite tasted like a total slushie.  The handmade Onion Rings tasted unbelieveable also.\nI know there are a few Sonic's in Jersey, but I am never really around there but the commercial play all over NY, nah mean. So the word is out there."
40,48,1,683,"Great pizza...but as another reviewer mentioned -- they are a bit feisty. Be forewarned that the slices are humungous, so one might do it if you have a small appetite, like moi."
126,142,1,7740,"I stopped in here today after seeing ads on group discount sites. I was impressed with all of the choices including cupcakes, handmade chocolates, cakes, and cookies. I tried a sweet potato cupcake that had the most amazing frosting. I also indulged in a red velvet cupcake, which I have yet to find a true version of here in Charlotte. This one met the mark. This was true red velvet cake, not chocolate cake dyed red like most I have tried here. The frosting was a perfect buttercream with a pecan garnish on top. I can't believe I have never visited this place before. This is a hidden gem!"
23,25,1,8885,"Great fresh bloody mary's!  Food was very good, and the atmosphere has a a lot of energy."
91,98,1,1217,"Just ate at Senor Tequila for the first time in a while. They have added some good specials at lunch time so the prices are very affordable. My lunch dish was under $7 and the quality of the food was good. As always, service can be hit or miss here, but I stil like the food and will definitely go back.   Also, they have taken over some space from next door, so finally the restaurant will be a little roomier."
45,54,1,4104,"The right formula!  Gourmet Food, No, but good food served in a very clean setting by thorougly friendly staff, and all at value-oriented pricing.  We love Gourmet Foodm but are also regular fans of IHOP!"
20,27,1,4466,Best place to eat in Charlotte!!! I go there at least twice a week!!!! A+++
147,160,1,4554,I love love love Red Velvet Cafe! I almost didn't want to write this review in fear of it becoming overly popular and having to wait haha.  My bf and I come almost once a week to get our fix. I'm always torn between the taco salad and one of their chicken paninis. I'm not a vegan so I get regular chicken but they are able to make it vegan if you are. The food is very consistent and comes out every time hot and delicious. The staff is extremely friendly and the owner is always there checking on the customers. Make sure you save room for dessert because it can't be beat. Everything I've tried has been great but I always find myself picking the peanut butter brownie. Mmmm!
37,42,1,960,What a great place.  Everyone was friendly.  The food was delicious.  Dinner for five and a child with drinks about $275.  The chef put on quite a show for us.
41,43,1,5905,"This is authentic Liberian food, I recommend the cassava leaf if it is available. The restaurant is basic but the food is good and spicy if you need it to be, ask for extra pepper."
45,48,1,2083,"They took me on a walk in. Great pricing, super friendly staff, and my girl did a nice job. Got a fill and gel polish with hearts for valentines day for $33. Can't complain about that!"
24,25,1,9029,Outs standing place to eat and enjoy the amazing drinks and great customer service and not to mention the beautiful atmosphere..
152,163,1,8703,"This was our first time here. The happy hour prices are very attractive. We got the Edamame app which was brought to the table in a cute little covered bowl that held the steam and flavor. Better yet, we use our check-in deal on Yelp mobile to get it for free. The beer selection is good and happy hour prices make it even better. We also ordered the Chicken Catsu which was one of the best versions of this dish we've had. The portion size is enough to split if you get a couple of appetizers too. The manager was fantastic, ensuring we got the happy hour prices even though we ordered just a few minutes before 6pm. He was very attentive and made sure the place was running smoothly. We'll definitely be back."
43,47,1,1413,"The donuts were pretty good. I'd definitely come in the morning when they are fresh because around the evening time, they're a bit stiff.\n\nPick your fancy, they are all good."
45,47,1,6523,Excellent service. Very good mushroom Kobe burger & truffle fries. Drink not as strong as I would like but acceptable.  Tables were clean & chairs very comfortable. Have eaten at this location before & have never been disappointed.
52,55,1,4604,"Stopped in to get brakes replaced. Discovered there was significant work that had to be done. Don and Patti are the BEST. They made an immediate opening for me, gave me a fair price and treated me with exceptional service. Highly recommend their service."
29,30,1,3692,Comfortable and clean. The people who work there are always friendly and I never have to worry when dropping the kids off for a movie.
44,49,1,6220,The security guard from April 3rd at noon is a complete jerk.  The women on staff are all extremely nice and make you feel comfortable.   I got my appt the next day and the wait time wasn't awful.
104,114,1,3305,"One of my favorite breakfast spots! I love the variety of their menu. I usually stick with the eggs special so I can order both sweet and savory items. The Nutella crepes are yummy, but I didn't like the scrambler I ordered. Too much stuff all mixed together. I like that I was able to substitute whatever flavor of pancakes I wanted for no extra charge. Chocolate chips ftw! Service is always great and make sure you make reservations otherwise you'll be waiting for 40 minutes like we did one day."
143,157,1,7324,"I was in need of a couple of tires for a full size pick up truck....being in need of a bargin I surfed the web and came across these reviews and had to give Big Earl a try. Let me tell you......those before me who wrote reviews were not lying. I first called and Big Earl answered and took the time to look up my tire size where most places would have rushed me off the phone. He told me what he did and did not have and what options would fit my vehicle. Great customer service. I made my way over and can certainly say, this business man is worth giving a try. He provides the service most business have forgotten about.....quick, economical and friendly."
86,89,1,4130,"Second time here, and both times I got a sandwich. Once I had the beef n sausage combo, today I got the beef lunch special. For 5.95 you can't go wrong. A big Italian beef sandwich with side of au jus and some fries, I left full and happy. Next time I'll try a pizza and update my review. But for now, this place is definitely in the lunch rotation."
240,276,1,2291,"I'm seriously giving this place a 5 star rating not because it's perfectly laid out  -- Woodman's East is really a dump. However this place has an insane variety of groceries and seriously has prices that are low, and by low, I mean lower than an Asian grocer.\n\nAnother really surprising aspect of this particular Woodman's is the variety of ethnic groceries. I have never seen chow pei yu sold in any place besides an Asian market, but this place has it. Basmati Rice is about half the price of whatever I get in Milwaukee (the city, not the street) and the beer selection in both Woodman's is incredible. Seriously, where else can you find Augustiner Br\u00e4u in Madison (or in practically any place in the U.S.)? You might think Riley's, but no, it's in good ol' Woodman's liquor section.\n\nMy real issue with Woodman's East is the frozen veggie section, which is quite lacking and not as cheap as the one in the west. Their tea selection is also lacking too. Both Woodman's stores have pretty bad seafood selection, but if you're looking for cheap and plentiful anything else, this place is it."
60,68,1,6412,"Since moving to NV, my husband and I are trying all of the buffets..Golden Nugget seems to be our default place when we can't decide on one. Its nice and simple, clean and friendly. Food is pretty good, nothing orgasmic and its reasonibly priced. Kids enjoy it too."
60,64,1,1180,Perfect pizza!  Found this place on Yelp on the way out of the Charlotte Airport. It looked so good I actually turned around and back-tracked a few miles. So glad that I did!  Friendly staff and great food!  Real Italian food - from a guy who grew up in Jersey b
93,100,1,6984,Took my moms phone to this guys place and the one lady said it would be 1 hour and when we got the phone back the phone was like new and done like promise. I will return. The owner let me take alot of his BUSSINESS CARDS to hand out and so I will make sure my friends and family go to him. He was very nice and awsome with me and  my mom. Thank you alot for fixing my moms phone. We will return.
37,41,1,9290,It's great to walk into a gluten-free establishment with no worries about cross-contamination. So many choices. The lime-banana bread was excellent. Great smoothies too!
187,222,1,474,We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table on a Friday night after 7pm.  It would have been a 30 minute wait for an outside table which would have been preferable to us.\n\nWent with my son and husband.  I ordered a Mangorita and enjoyed it.  My husbands Pina Colada was also very tasty.\n\nHusband got pork tacos and was happy with them.  Son got a teriyaki burger and loved it.  I had a Hula veggie burger and it was good but I was wishing I had ordered the Teriyaki one also.  I ordered the french fries with cheese and scallions on them.  At first they tasted good but then they started to taste fishy.  (The likely fry them in the same oil?)\n\nGreat place to bring the kids.  Service is good and the ambiance is fun.  The kids meals are a great size.  My two littlest ones could easily share one meal if we bring them next time.
70,76,1,9248,"I have been to Nan and Byron's several times now and love it more each time. The Nightshade Martini is hands down the best martini I've ever tasted. My favorite entree is the 8 oz. Prime Rib with the mac n cheese. The mac n cheese is a MUST TRY. Great service, great environment - definitely recommend this place."
85,92,1,3090,"Great breakfast, and it's very convenient being in the THEhotel if you are staying there. I ate here when THEhotel first opened, it was great then and seems to have maintained its consistency even many years later. I had the french toast which was a lot of food, my mom had just the fruit and some toast but everything really was quality ingredients. I will absolutely be back next time I stay at the THEhotel."
80,91,1,3187,"I am not at all a bar food person. I would call the Yard House upscale bar food, and I have liked everything I've ordered here. Their food is very solid. Their steak and ahi tuna salads are great, and I also like their burgers. I could seriously eat their fries and aioli until I throw up, so I deduct a star for tempting me to indulge in bulimia."
74,79,1,2304,"By far the best restaurant meatballs and Italian sausage I have ever eaten.  My girlfriend and I ate, or should I say gorged ourselves, here for lunch.  The pizza was also very good and was even better the next day cold.  Service was a bit slow and they kept for getting things or else I would have given this place 5 stars their delicious food deserves."
56,59,1,6929,"I came for dinner after work, and it was my first trip to this location. The line was huge but moved quickly.  The staff was friendly and the food awesome as always at every chipotle I've been to. Would definitely recommend them, and will certainly be back!"
149,154,1,8133,"Alright so like most of my reviews it was my first time here. I got the Grilled Chicken Broken Rice I believe it was R5 on the menu. It was pretty good I'm not going to lie. But the rice was a little sweet. Because they give you fish sauce and I was just listening to my sister when she said to pour it on the rice and the chicken. Maybe next time I can put a little less on but it was definitely good. The chicken was also pretty good and if you like spicy things you should use the chili paste, in the rice and on the chicken. I will possibly come here again but I don't think it's worth the drive for me. It is good but not to die for."
77,86,1,2036,"Brief: Great fresh sushi, usually a wait, No Name roll!\n\nOne of my favorite sushi places in Vegas. YUM! There's such a variety and for those who don't like the extra sauces and papers there are more plain rolls that are just as tasty and fresh. If there's anything worth mentioning is about Yama is that the fish is always fresh!"
77,83,1,6705,"Great place for BBQ in Anthem. When you get a chance try their creation called the Hog Dog, don't be scared it's not as spicy as the description may imply. The Ribs are better than average, the fried macaroni and cheese lacks flavor. As for everything else on the menu, it's great. I can say that because I have tasted the whole menu already."
169,184,1,7808,"This is a clean and well run childcare center.  The front desk staff are helpful and courteous.  But the best thing about this facility is the low rate of employee turnover.  I have worked in the childcare industry and can speak from experience that this is very unusual.  My son has been in the 3 year old class since September '11 and has had the very same teachers the whole time.  They are both educated and caring and provide a fun, safe environment for the children in their class.  They really go above and beyond to provide activities that support weekly themes, etc.  This week in honor of the 4th of July they are tie-dying shirts in red, white and blue.  This sort of environment is generally driven top down and the director of the school sets a good example of both high expectations and approachability.  I would highly recommend this facility."
75,90,1,8012,"This is a small, no-nonsense creperie with a wide selection of items. I wanted to get something light and the associate at the counter was able to convert their Florentine Crepe into an omelet for me. The portion size was more than sufficient and the food tasted fresh. It's a great spot--very clean and they use compostable and recyclable cups, plates etc."
27,29,1,8965,The food is good!! I must admit they make good tacos but they are not great! The service is good as well.
159,165,1,3095,"Richard is the best driver ever. I don't know if he's still working there. We have not ridden the Deuce in years. We are monorail people now. We were riding it before purchasing your tickets before hand. I think the system is better now. Richard is a blast. We always made sure to get on his bus. He joked and laughed. He also gave great advice on food. He was just a fun, great guy all around. One night, we were riding and my mom who was at the top of the bus did not get off with us. She was in la la land? I don't know. Richard took my mom's phone and called her husband asking if she had left anything behind. It was hilarious. We laugh about it to this day."
26,28,1,8658,This is the best place to get your haircut and I always enjoy getting my haircut. Thanks for all your great service.
80,90,1,8225,"I love this restaurant! Just wondering if my connections in Charlotte will allow myself sometime to eat here, breakfast, lunch or dinner, great wine and great price! Charming decoration and perfect service. What else would you expect in a restaurant? Ah, food! Deliciousness in detail! My faves: croissant with omelet for the morning, ceviche and the little fondue for lunch and dinner. Awesome salads!"
223,279,1,3309,"**Summary**\n       - Quality - One thing I love about Heidi's is their quality. They bake their bread right there and have a wide selection. Their meats are fresh and delicious.\n       - Portion - The other thing about Heidi's sandwiches is that they're big. Thick slices of bread, Large helpings of meat.\n       - Price - Most sandwiches are around $8. All sandwiches come with a small side. There's also a deal during lunch for half a sandwich, chips, and a drink for $5.\n**Favorites**\n       - Transplanted New Yorker - Sinfully fatty deli meats with avocado and their signature secret cajun sauce. Every bite is deliciously salty and spicy.\n       - Bronx Bomber - Pastrami and egg salad. I usually add their cajun sauce to this to seal the deal. If you like pastrami and egg salad, you have to get this. Be warned however, this is a pretty large sandwich and you are in danger of a food coma after wards.\n**Recommendations**\n       - I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quality sandwich."
175,197,1,6884,"I think you can see from the number of times I've checked into this place that I love it hear. It's not just the food, it's the staff too. They're sweet as pie. :) \n\nThe food is great too and the location is awesome. I know the wait can be long, but you can get a text and go to the mall. That's what we do. \n\nNow for food if you are a sushi love the rolls are huge. So thick you almost can't get them in you mouth and rolled tight! They also amazing nigiri plates, and burgers for non sushi eaters an then there's the filet mignon sushi roll. Yup and yes you can have that stuffed with lobster. So yeah, I come for the food stay for the friendly and fast service. It's a big ol bonus!\n:) time"
25,26,1,6972,Best cup cakes and chocolate covered bacon you will ever eat hands down!! Another bad ass hole in da wall place!
108,118,1,5702,I really love this store! This pet store really cares about customer service to the fullest. I was interested in a certain flavor of Nature's Variety in the medium size bag and they only had Lamb and Oatmeal in the smaller bag. Because they pride themselves on customer service they discounted the smaller bag for me because of the inconvenience and ordered me the medium bag that they are also giving me a discount on. I THINK THAT IS AWESOME! They also donate any returned bags of food the the animal shelter and I think that is pretty amazing :)
45,49,1,624,They did the best color I've ever had and they were able to take me the same day I called in. The prices are very reasonable considering how good the service is. I'd reccomend anyone to this spa!
58,69,1,5362,"Paciugo has CLOSED!\n\nA new gelato place has taken over this location though - La Coppa.  A friend and I ate there this past weekend and they were very good - just need to expand their variety of flavors to some that a little more inventive, as Paciugo did."
108,112,1,9685,"This place is so much fun! I wish I could remember the name of our server, he was absolutely fantastic! I even forgot my dessert at the table and he chased us out the door to bring it to us! It was very busy but definitely fun to be able to play ping pong while we waited for our table! The only down side is that it is on the pricey side and as good as the food is, I'm not sure it's worth the amount we spent. Will probably go back for drinks and apps!"
39,45,1,1112,"This is a nice Starbucks location: friendly baristas, and it's big enough to sit and stay for a while on the cushy chairs. Only drawback of this location is the limited parking."
202,215,1,7755,this place-great service! I found this place about a year ago & moved so I stopped going but today I ventured back here on a random whim. It felt so good to go back! Hispanic Jackie did my pedicure & nails & she was such a sweetheart with amazing technique & serious massage skills! Tiny but strong hands! The owner & her daughters want customers to have first class service so no one is rushed thru & it's a real chill vibe! You notice right away the customers are all loyal long standing customers & the girls make everyone feel part of the family! I also noticed they are honest about wait times! They dont lie & say 10 min like most nail shops because they aren't pushing people thru like cattle! Extremely clean & all supplies are new & sterilized! It's best to make an appointment ahead of time! I was lucky to get in as a walk in! Asian Jackie creates art with her nail brush & it was fun watching her in action & hears the oooh & awwws!
40,53,1,668,"The only items worth getting here are the pollo blanco enchiladas, the chimichanga or the mexican pizza. The trifecta will not disappoint. If you order anything else, don't come complaining to me!"
29,33,1,3071,Ate at the bar. Amy helped me out with the drinks and recommended the ribeye. Awesome food and awesomer service. Thanks again Amy!
8,8,1,7749,Great service and clean establishment!
15,17,1,8361,Good AYCE. No complaints nice variety of items on the menu.
55,61,1,582,This restaurant serves really good mexican food at reasonable prices. The location and decor are great and make it look like a really expensive restaurant without the high prices. The service is almost always top-notch and prompt. My pick from the extensive menu would be the enchiladas.
94,105,1,8855,"Awesome food! The chef and the staff and beyond generous and hospitable! While every white person in my family ordered variations of the burrito, I went left and ordered carne asada tacos. Perfect size, nice spice, and the ingredients were as fresh as possible! Everyone in my party enjoyed the location and decor. Shout outs to Frank and his mom who takes pics every five minutes.\n\nIf you want great food, grab a shot and some flautas here!"
30,35,1,9255,"Was quite surprised to enjoy a very tasty carne asada torta the other day. It came with hot and tasty fries, too. Good sandwich!"
220,236,1,1084,"Restaurant/brewery in an old church you say? I'm intrigued.\n\nChurch Brew Works gives you some really good food in a cool atmosphere. I'm not a drinker so I can't report on the brews. Had a pasta dish with shrimp. It was very good. I think all of us really liked our dishes except for maybe the couscous salad. Didn't try the pizza but some of those looked really good.\n\nWe had to wait about 30-45 minutes for a seat but in part because we didn't mind waiting and didn't feel like hovering in the half of the restaurant with open seating. They take reservations for groups of 8 or larger. Prices are a little on the higher end, but so is the food. Main dishes are in the 15-25 range but they are filling and taste great. Good, knowledgeable servers.\n\nMy only real complaint, the very poorly marked front entrance. FYI, it is the center door at the front of the church, which seems logical but when you are there, it is not easy to tell."
61,68,1,2588,"Very good pizza! It had a great selection of pizzas and appetizers. We would love to try their pasta nights sometime soon! Food came out fast, and the place was clean. Love the ambiance of the place and that it is a converted historic home in downtoan Phoenix. Definitely try it out!"
39,47,1,3059,PNC Park is a picturesque dollhouse of a ballpark. Great venue to unwind after work in or a business trip to Pittsburgh. Sit on the third baseline for a surrealistically close vista of cityscape.
75,80,1,76,"My wife and I came in last week to get ourselves a new mattress.  Our salesman, Antwan, was interested in helping us get the right bed, not the most expensive one.  We ended up purchasing one, had it delivered and put into place the next day.  Been sleeping great since then.  Recommend checking them out when your in the market for a new mattress."
135,150,1,4934,"This cafe is really quaint, and quiet. The atmosphere is very welcoming. There isn't many places to sit when it's busy, but there is some outdoor seating for nicer weather. It's located near where I live, and the food is pretty satisfying. Their sandwiches use waffles as their bread. I never would have thought that it would taste so good! I got a regular waffle with strawberries, banana, whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Pretty typical desert waffle. Nothing out of the ordinary, but the waffles were really crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and not too sweet. Exactly what a waffle should be. We'll be returning here for sure."
120,129,1,6195,"I've stayed here a few times and have always enjoyed it.  But I will tell you, that you can hear the thump thump thump of the music being played at the pool and clubs till 4 am in the morning, so be cautions of what side of the building you stay.\n\nThe rooms are remarkable, clean and modern.  It's a big place, and they offer tons of stuff for almost any demographic.  Put on your walking shoes, because it's a big place and you'll be on your feet a lot.  Hope you enjoy it here as much as we did."
78,88,1,9324,"Two friends and I visited Blue Sky today for the first time.  We all had mani/pedis and it was sheer heaven for all three of us!!  The pedicures they offer were the best any of us have ever had!!  I pass at least 10 salons on the way to Blue Sky but WELL worth the trip!  I'm now a regular, they have won us over for life!"
105,124,1,6337,Great experience! Drinks are delicious but a bit pricy at $14-16 per cocktail but it is Vegas...the Lobster rolls were loaded with lobster great dish! The roasted chicken pot pie was not your traditional pie the filling was too cheesy for my taste and the biscuit topping was dense and lacking that flakey texture you expect. Perfect place for large groups. \nOysters are fresh and the house made horseradish sets em off! $2 each\nHostess seemed highly stressed was very short with us. Our waitress however was very friendly and attentive.
80,89,1,592,"I've been coming to Tag's for about a year or so and found it to be wonderful place and yes, a trip back in time. Tag's menu incorporate both southwest and American foods in over sized quantities.  While you're there I would recommend the locally made knick-knacks along the walls that you can purchase.  The food is good and service is great!\n\nEnjoy!"
33,34,1,7150,Love this place! People that work there are awesome and always remember us & what we like. Who doesn't want to go to a place like that.
47,54,1,5288,"Flat Iron Steak was prepared very well, delivered Medium Rare exactly. Exemplary service and friendly staff.  My iced tea glass was refilled regularly. Nothing to complain about here. Good chain restaurant with predictably good quality and predictably good service."
41,48,1,4525,"Went kayaking with Brandon. He is very knowledgeable about Nevada - had cultural, historical, and geograhical tidbits to share. He was prompt, organized, and seemed to really love his job. Thanks!"
45,48,1,705,"If you want to spend time on the internet and have a nice meal this is a great place for it.  Some things on the menu are better than others, but the ambiance is nice and the wifi works well."
123,125,1,9522,"Great food! I am really happy this location opened. Though I understand it's still their first week open, I have been three times since they opened and every time the line to order is really long and slow moving. It wouldn't be a huge problem if it was long and moved fast but it moves so slow. Granted the employees are still new and learning. I hope they figure it out so the ordering process will be faster. But overall , the food is excellent and priced well. I was sad to see so many people walk in and then walk out once they saw the slow moving ordering line."
37,41,1,5229,"Great dinner.  Went last night, food was great, wine was great, service was excellent and attentive.  Ambiance was perfect for our dinner party of 4.  Everyone enjoyed it."
48,53,1,1339,"This is my very favorite of all scrapbook stores! They have the best selection, the nicest staff and great vintage items! Be prepared to spend lots of time because there is so much to see! Great classes withfabulous teachers as well."
70,73,1,4094,I decided to try this location again on 8/24 and unlike the first time everything was very good from the start to the end. My server Ryan was very friendly and polite. Beer was very cold and my food was delicious. i love their calamary! My friend tried Lobster tacos and they were awesome! I enjoyed my visit very much!
103,112,1,8786,"I had somewhat high hopes, and I like their logo, the building and the restaurant design. The service was a bit odd - the server seemed confused, and they were out of some drinks and food. We pushed on and each had a bowl of ramen - mine was pork based with garlic and kimchi - similar to what I've had on Honshu near Korea. It was OK - and certainly nothing like authentic. The edamame was above average. Worried about their survival as Arizona needs ramen shops of every quality."
189,197,1,8788,"I was excited to see an urgent care pop up closer to home than the one at 7th ave and Camelback. I hurt my neck about a month ago and with the pain increasingly impacting my daily function, I decided to drop in. This location is at 3rd ave and Thomas, south of the hospital. It is a new place and at 2:30 pm on a Monday was empty. I filled in some paperwork and was brought back quickly. The P.A. on staff thought my issue was whiplash but said they wanted to x rays to be sure. I was so happy they could do that on site and give me preliminary results that there wasn't anything serious going on. I was in and out in 35 minutes and got a few calls the next days making sure I was feeling better. I did get called at home, work, and cell phone which I thought was overkill. But overall, I was very happy with their service."
28,28,1,6786,I have try this place again today Sunday night and the service was much better. Getting served by the GM awesome service and food.
67,71,1,7538,Love love this place. I have been here so many time i can't recall. Frist time was with my boyfriend. Tend to be a bit crowded some time. The service is always quick and they make super good coffee and the cakes/muffin/tart are always so good. I always look forward on trying new dessert.
69,77,1,5763,"Frank & Albert's is probobly one of my favorite restaurants in town. The menu is creative and the ingredients are very fresh - its just good, unpretentious comfort food made and served in the best way possible. The home-made ketchup and mustard are excellent additions to the delicious onion rings and duck fat fries. The drinks are also innovative."
56,57,1,4625,The best place to the country to have you Ferrari services. All the service guys are awesome. They are honest and they do a good job. I bring my car here from California for service. I'm not the only guy that does that. There is a reason.
11,11,1,6027,Great food and great service. Coming back.
51,57,1,3133,"Best sushi in Vegas! probably my favorite restaurant in town...The prices are kinda high, but well worth it..if the chef recommends it...order it! still wishing they had a happy hour so i could afford to go more! cheers!"
189,215,1,794,"I come from a long line of great piemakers. My grandmother sometimes made an apple pie a day. My family made plans to visit the cafe on our way home from Sedona and I kept telling myself to not expect too much. Restaurant pies are usually way over-hyped. We loved this place!!! The hostess was a real sweetie and Miles, our server, was flat out adorable. We sampled the rhubarb crumble, pecan, Tennessee lemon, and mixed berry crumble. My Mom and I felt we were the hands down winner with the rhubarb crumble. It was perfect, tart but plenty sweet enough, with a yummy crumble topping. We pride ourselves on our homemade pecan pie and the Rock Springs Cafe version was a serious contender. Plus the serving slice was huge. The mixed berry crumble was really good. The only one I wouldn't recommend was the Tennessee lemon. It was good but just not to my taste. It was like a lemon custard."
34,37,1,3609,"Good, solid Starbucks location.  I have been here a handful of times.  They have been fast and get the orders right.  What else can you ask for?"
8,9,1,8206,Cheapest gas in the neighborhood!
139,156,1,3064,"This place has the best Tuna Sandwich in Las Vegas! Yes... even better than Earl of Sandwich. They put it on sourdough and the tuna they use is fantastic. It may be a 9 dollar sandwich but hot damn its good! I even thought that their fries were tasty!\n\nYou can't miss this place, it's a deli style set up with tables to bring your numbers to.  Their lemonade is fantastic and it's right next to their sportsbook. You can even see the sportsbook screens from there and they have flat screens showing games too.\n\nIt's a tad on the pricey side but hey, you're staying at the Wynn, that should be expected."
32,32,1,1369,Always delicious. Really nice people as well. Only complaint is that the delivery takes a little while. If they delivered faster they would be the best.
81,92,1,3078,Finally returned to N9NE and it has certainly earned its spot as an iconic Vegas restaurant. The bread basket alone is worth a visit and while I'm not normally a lobster bisque fan... THIS lobster bisque is dish that all should experience at least once in their life. Impeccable service from Char at the center bar and don't even get me started on the Fire Chicken. Can't wait to go back!
118,126,1,3455,"I have driven by the this place countless times and never even knew it was there. It's tucked into a tiny strip mall on the north side. The owners/employees are extremely friendly and very helpful. We ordered a Philly Mushroom Cheese Steak and a Turkey Hoagie. Although both were delicious, we agreed the Cheese Steak was amazing. It's a little bit of a drive for us but will continue to go back because it was that good. I highly recommend trying this hidden little gem. It's as close to the real thing as you're going to get without going to Philly."
41,44,1,2758,"My favorite BBQ joint by far. Portions are generous, sauces are amazing, and I absolutely love the deep fried pickles. My only wish is that one would open up near me in Northern California!"
21,25,1,6080,LOVE Port of Subs!  My favorite sub chain.  I just wish they were more conveniently located.
182,214,1,7759,"Had dinner with my wife on 9/4/2013.  Service and food were top-notch, we were seated within 10 minutes even though it was crowded around 7:30.  We had two appetizers and the small Round New York Cheese pizza.  My wife had the Eggplant Pizzettes, 3 breaded discs with ricotta and a very tasty marinara sauce.  I had the Tomato & Burrata, which is their version of Caprese salad.  Instead of sliced tomatoes, sliced mozzarella, and basil, this had a circle of quartered small tomatoes around a big ball of fresh mozzarella.  The plate was also seasoned with olive oil and basalmic.  The mozzarella was absolutely the freshest I've ever had, but our server told us that it was not made in the restaurant.  The pizza was excellent, great cheese, great sauce, great crust.  Next time we're back in Las Vegas, I want to try the Baked Ziti and Brooklyn Chicken."
65,70,1,7744,Deana is awesome!! She is so friendly and really listens to exactly what you what before deciding the right path to take to get your hair perfect! I could tell she had my best interest in mind through the entire appointment. Love the way my hair color turned out!! Thanks again! And I'll see you soon!
82,86,1,3914,"first friday is a great way to discover new local artists and keep up to date on local culture. there's lots of great galleries with something for just about everyone and every kind of art collecting budget. i agree with the fact that parking is sometimes tuff, but it always excites me to see many people coming down to the event to support it. a few extra blocks of walking is no big deal."
60,60,1,5430,"This place is pretty good. Big portions. Big salad. Good food. Not good for the diet, but hey. What Italian food is? If you take the kids, take something for them to do. A bit of a wait for food. Good things come to those who wait."
229,259,1,2110,"I went here for an early bird dinner after an afternoon of shopping, and it was just perfect.  It was before the dinner crowd, so it was nice and quiet, cool, and clean.  The booth was so comfortable, and had an amazing high back to the seat.  We received great service, and the food was amazing.\n\nMy friend and I shared the caprese, made with buffalo mozzerella, just divine, and the others had the stuffed mushrooms.  I am not a fan of mushrooms, but they had nothing but wonderful things to say.  They have a pretty great early bird special that the group took advantage of.  By the way, if you order soup, don't expect a little cup.  You get a large bowl of delicious minestrone.  After that and appetizers, it's almost impossible to complete your meal.  I had the capellini, which is great fresh and great microwaved.  The rest of the group had eggplant parmesan and spaghetti, meat lasagna and spaghetti, and this chicken and mushroom with fettucine plate.  Everyone was full and happy with their choices.\n\nI would love to return on my next trip to Vegas."
41,46,1,9330,This was my first time at TiJuana Flats and the customer service was excellent! I work in the customer service industry as well so I greatly appreciate good service. Rosie and her team we're lovely!!!
84,92,1,7135,"LOVE this Starbucks! After having gone to MULTIPLE locations on the strip and having my Starbucks Double shot made incorrectly every time, coming to this location and having my drink not only just made correctly but made very fuhreakin well; I'm in heaven. Oh yeah and the 2 baristas working were very interactive and friendly, which made it twice as nice. Nothing like your favorite drink made great with a side of friendly conversation."
74,84,1,2231,"my favorite lunch spot everytime i come to vegas.  they have a great selection of burgers and the largest assortment of topping i have ever seen in my life.  i love the jalapeno bacon and the kobe burger.  for the non meat lovers, they also serve a great salmon burger as well.\n\nbe prepared to wait a little if you arrive there late."
203,229,1,10,"My girlfriend and I went to Casbah for the first time recently and we both enjoyed our experience.\n\nThe atmosphere is dressy, but the restaurant isn't so formal that it feels stuffy or uncomfortable, which is a welcome change compared to most classy restaurants.  The environment was relaxed, and it was easy to have a quiet conversation throughout the meal.  As for the meal itself, we had a reservation and were promptly seated when we showed up.\n\nOur waiter was courteous and provided good, fast service without being overbearing or constantly hovering, which was quite nice.  For an appetizer, we ordered the cheese tray which was tasty as well as fun and unique.\n\nFollowing the cheese tray, I dined on the cioppino while my girlfriend had the casereccia.  Both dishes were tasty and our seafood was skillfully cooked, particularly the sea bass in my dish which was delicious.\n\nI'd recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to celebrate an occasion or have some good, out of the ordinary food."
66,69,1,8449,"Came in for an alignment. Hands down, best price in town! Customer service is top notch. It is a family owned small business but sometimes it's best to trust with your vehicle. I will be returning even it's on the other side of town for me. Worth it! Glad I found them on Yelp!"
213,227,1,3011,"Great Greek food. Truly excellent. Terrific service from an attentive and friendly waiter. I took my mom here and she had the Greek salad as her main and the flan for dessert. When the waiter started listing the specials, I stopped him after the first one - a seafood pasta with shrimp, scallops and a white wine sauce. It sounded excellent and it was very delicious. He had to bring us two more baskets of bread so that I could soak up all of that great sauce!\n\nI had no idea there was Greek beer but I had one here - something called Mythos in a bottle that tasted like Heineken. It was great with the pasta.\n\nParking at Greek Isles isn't usually a problem. They have a private reserved lot that is just across the street. Or take the Lynx to the Bland station.\n\nOne warning. What meal wouldn't be complete without something bursting into flame right behind your head? They serve some sort of special meal that gets a shot of liquor at the table for that special event. Opa!"
48,53,1,93,"Not a lot to say other than great southern comfort food. Good fried chicken, great beef ribs. Small servings of ribs, but great flavor. Loved the collard greens and coconut cake. I'd go back. Definately worth trying."
41,51,1,6384,Shakes were so yummy!!!! Got the Kobe burger and zen burger... They were both great! Also ordered the zucchini fries.. They were pretty good but I have had better. Regular fries were great!!
168,187,1,2886,"Sassi's is a fantastic place for a special occasions.  Of course, if you have a big enough food budget you could go for fun all the time!  The ambiance is top-notch, and the building itself is beautiful.  I would sit outside near sunset in nice weather if possible.  Gorgeous views.\n\nThe food, wine, and service is also top-notch.  I've eaten here several times and each time the food blew us away, and the waitstaff is very knowledgable and enjoyable to talk to.  All the plates just seem to be perfect.  Whether we had the small plate of nuts for an appetizer, or a beef or fish main course, or the desert, it all was presented beautifully and was delicious.  This is probably the best restaurant overall that I've been to, and I've been to a lot!"
74,80,1,7851,"Do My Nails is a great, fun place to get a good pedicure and manicure. I go every two weeks and the staff remembers you by name after your first visit. They are fun, energetic, and they do excellent work. The salon has plenty of pedicure seats with massage options and they are clean and efficient. I would highly recommend this salon to anyone."
194,237,1,1149,"What a great date spot! So romantic....I could see the Match.com love in the air.....  I have been here over the years several times (no not for Match!), and again last night due to a citipass bogo coupon. It is much better than I remembered!  My friend and I shared the chicken and andouille sausage soup which was DIVINE ($4). I had the chicken marsala and my friend had the seafood risotto. The marsala was probably enough for two people - it was a huge plate of fettuccine with two grilled chicken breasts and a ton of mushrooms. Thank god they are smart enough to do fresh (not canned) mushrooms. So perfect. \n\nThe seafood risotto was very good- it came with 6 mussels plopped on top which were lightly seasoned. My friend said some of the scallops in the risotto were a tiny bit tough but overall it was excellent. Entrees were about 13 bucks a piece, very worth the price! I will definitely be back!!! :-D"
63,70,1,7659,"Tried the Triple Bypass Burger with bacon. It was fresh and tasty. Add salt and pepper as needed. Fries were great and shake was good but too thick for me. Washed it down with a 24oz Miller Highlife.\n\nMust try just for the experience, the kids enjoyed their food as well!"
191,201,1,6932,"We got off to a rocky start, they were overwhelmed by their newfound success on a Saturday night.  We sat down and waited and waited and waited for someone, anyone to acknowledge our existence.  We were the only Asian folk there but I guess we're not their target audience...Just before we were about to leave they at least brought water - which had a bug in it.  Oh Well, it did just open so we ordered away.  The food is very good and nicely spicy.  The apps are excellent and the menu variety is nice and interesting.  My Thai wife approved.  The space is beautiful and let's face it the rent in Gainey village must be astronomical which explains their higher prices.(they even charge for rice - our sticky rice was old)  Once they iron out their service issues it should get much better.  I can get Thai food nearly as good for cheaper in Chandler where I live but for a date night out this place will do nicely."
113,121,1,5050,"I really like Burton. I would much rather see a guy who was kitted out in the stuff here than the likes of the skinny jeans in Topman. Over style conscious guys make me feel a little uncomfortable as while I love clothes, I never particularly follow any trends, I just march to the beat of my own drum.\n\nBurton stocks tees, hoodys, jeans, nice shirts and all at very reasonable prices, the staff in this branch are also very friendly and the few times I've popped in with guy friends they've always left with something."
66,71,1,3033,"The food is absolutely amazing!!! And the the people are great! The crack bread is absolutely a must have, you won't be disappointed! If you're looking for a cute date night spot,  try it out on a Thursday night for their $25 date night special,  you will be hooked just like the rest of us!"
44,47,1,7061,"I've always been a buffet type of guy n always want a buffet to have a good set of seafood selection, this place didn't have a good varieties of choices but it was good quality grub.word."
171,193,1,2301,"As often as I go here (about 2 to 3 times a month) I can't believe I haven't written a review! \nI LOVE AZ88!! I go here for lunch with girlfriends and have the fabulous AZ88 salad with ice tea, or martinis with friends (the best in town!) and an appetizer or two to share. The food is plentiful and delicious, a big step up from 'bar' food, but not fancy and not pricey either. The staff is always friendly and attentive. When the weather is nice, they have a lovely patio that actually looks out on a green belt/park area and not a parking lot! But indoors is also a treat with fabulous art and a modern design. If you go at the holidays you can also see their annual \""""tree\"""" in the dead center of the restaurant. Always a wonderful work of art!"
114,129,1,3044,"fabulous food, great price. The ladies who make the food and bring it out are sweet and wonderful people who make me feel like i'm at their house instead of at a restaurant.  If i could change anything it would be the guys at the front- the older gentleman chews tobacco while he's talking to you and sometimes spits, and the younger one- I guess his son- has a serious lack of people skills but i'll put up with both for the goodies that come out of that kitchen- try the vada paav or the gol guppa chaat....yum."
153,169,1,8104,"I went to Heist for dinner and beer a few months ago.  I really wanted to be a fan of Heist since it is in my hood, but dinner was nothing special.  In fact, it wasn't good.  The food left a lot to be desired, and the beer was just gross.\n\nHOWEVER....the brunch here is AMAZING!! The food is so unique and flavorful.  It's buffet style, and there are lots of options to include a waffle bar.  I've been three times, and usually I don't even eat any other meal during the day after this super satisfying feast.  The coffee is ok.  I had to drink my coffee out of a beer glass which was kind of weird but the coffee still made it to the party."
93,100,1,8212,Beer! There is not much else to say! The Beer selection here at WOB is awesome with over 50 rotating taps and 10 beer frigs shelving hundreds of bottles even some 22oz selections! WOB has domestic as well as regions all over the world with all different price points and types. When it comes to the tap they keep it seasonal and try to get limited batches that other bars may not have! I think I found my new spot for winding down after work!
78,83,1,1090,"The Exchange has the biggest inventory of used CDs and movies in the city, so even if one location doesn't have what you're looking for, another location might. I bought a bunch of CDs here before I started downloading everything, and I still occasionally purchase a PS2 game or DVD here. The prices could stand to be a couple bucks cheaper, but otherwise it's all good."
182,203,1,5896,"Exquisite drinks. Up until this point I had never thought that making drinks could be an art in itself. Silly me.\n\nSince I've heard their food menu is questionable, I've never tried it. Thus, this review is for the DRINKS seulement. \n\nI've seen the ingredients they've used to make the drink menu here, and it's all high quality, each concoction made with care. The skills that go into each item is apparent in the fact that they put in quite a bit of alcohol in each (about three shots of liquor per average sized drink) and somehow they play in the taste of the alcohol and turn it into an actual flavor you enjoy. Note, the alcohol flavor isn't masked, only mused with in a way that benefits the overall palate. \n\nIf it's your first time there, try the \""""Sexual Chocolate.\"""" Thank me later :)"
105,113,1,6486,"Came across this place on a whim, but glad I stopped in. Defiantly has some unique burgers on the menu. I went with a pork and beef burger with Chinese sausage on a Taro bun. Also had some mushrooms on it. Good flavor and the taro bun actually had taro flavor to it! Bad part of the meal would be that the fries did not come with the burger, everything is ala cart.  I liked the sauce that came with the fries. Would recommend anyone to come here that's going to Vegas."
69,75,1,8583,"Great place and outstanding food. If you want something authentic you have to checkout Back Yard Taco. Its not your traditional mexican food, the Crazy Potato is amazing and I love the street tacos. I have already referred many family and friends.\n\nCheck them out you will be glad you do, or your LOCO if you dont!"
254,294,1,3014,"What can I say that hasn't been said yet!?!?!!? Came here around 4 with 5 gfs thinking we were coming at an 'off' time... yeah, we were wrong.  Still waiting an hr and 15 mins to get seated.  \n\nFYI- they don't skip people in line if ONE seat opens up and there's a group of 4 next in line.  So don't get upset if you say random seats empty... they're clearing it out for the next GROUP or PERSON in line.   At first we were like... WHYYYY are there open seats.. but then we realized.  \n\nWe told the person that we would take seats of two or three or five-whichever opened up first!  \n\nThe pan roast is AMAZING.  Level 8... I wish I got level 10 but we were sharing.  Ordered the rice on the side so that way all the sauce wouldn't seep into the rice right away- PLUS you can take leftovers to go!  \n\nThe chef and employees are all amazing and super nice!  Can't wait to come back. This definitely will be a must every time I'm in Vegas from here on out.  \n\nActually, my gfs and I are already planning to do a pan roast party at home, SOON!"
26,28,1,6435,OMG! Their Pizza is so good. They have a really good thin crusted pizza which I looked for months in Pittsburgh!
82,96,1,4184,"AMAZING food, drinks, and service!!!! It is nice to splurge once in a while, and I recommend this place for Romantic dinners, or maybe even a business dinner!!! The Lobster and steak is to die for. Extremely classy place. Very expensive, but was worth it! The Champagne was flowing, and we were front row to the GREAT live band!!! This is a MUST TRY place in Scottsdale!!!!"
49,51,1,952,"The food was pretty good, but come armed with lots of patience, because they are very slow to fill your order.\nThe price was right and one full star goes to the cute friendly waiter that gave us a hug, Cheers!"
104,113,1,7825,Staff was friendly and attentive. I ordered the oysters which where pretty good. My fried tasted crispy but my sliders were overcooked as where my friends chicken he ordered. It was absurdly loud with all the men cheering and shouting each time some character ran to the other side of the field on their TV show. It's really hot here in Phoenix so apparently the uniform here is very heat driven. Had an ok time but they should turn down the TV or just turn it off. It makes the other customers go crazy.
51,62,1,2407,Bar staff in patio is amazing. Marlin and Adrian were very friendly and just made our day. Adrian suggested the scalops which were a great recomdation..the duck that marinated for 24hrs are to die for !! make it a point to stop by locals !!
19,19,1,8008,Great customer service from Angela and I love there cup cakes. Local business kick butt!
153,165,1,4665,"Very fun and chill atmosphere, not too loud or crowded on a Tuesday night (of course). Unfortunately it had been raining a lot and there was no terrace setup, but I would like to go back and check it out next time. The bartender was a tad snobby (he only spoke French and when I tried to speak slowly in English my local friend just ended up telling him in French what I was saying), but that wasn't a big deal. He seemed skeptical that I would like the apparently strong IPA I had ordered, but I like IPAs and it's not his business really! :]\n\nAside from that, I had a great time sitting at the bar and chatting with a friend. I'd go back if I'm in Montreal again someday."
41,46,1,8823,"The Vegan is amazing, and I have dreams of it at night! It is a decent sized healthy meal for $5, and I am so glad they have currently added more hours espcially at night!"
94,106,1,5933,"Not having had a real haircut in years I was incredibly apprehensive about going, but Karen did a fantabulous job. I look 15 years younger and feel like I need to buy new clothes to match my wonderful hair!! The only minor complaint I have is the window says walk-ins are welcome, but no one was available until an hour later. If I didn't live so close, that may have prevented me from returning. What a travesty that would have been!!"
67,76,1,2168,"New Latino Fridays are a nice change to the LGBT nightlife!  Although, you don't need to be gay to have a great night!  Great martinis and creative bartenders that know their stuff!  Taco Stand on the patio and Hip Hop in the Miami Room.  Plenty of areas to walk around and very versatile place!  Nicest in Phoenix!"
128,136,1,7896,"Have only been once but will go back!  Was greeted by the owner when I walked in.  She was available but didn't follow me around which I greatly appreciated.  The items range from new to vintage and are reasonably priced.  There is clothing from casual to cocktail, jewelry, accessories, shoes, a section of men's items, home decor, and art.  Some of the items were locally made.  I bought a great candle and the exact type of shirt I went in hoping to find.  The house is beautiful and I really enjoyed the experience of shopping there.  The items change regularly so there should always be something new to see."
27,29,1,1770,"If you like local Hawaiian food, this is the place to go. Comfort food for islanders and islanders-at-heart."
243,273,1,7020,"I love astronaut cows! So cute! So cute and DELICIOUS!\n\nSo I had no clue what to expect from Holsteins, was it going to be amazing like Gordon Ramsay's BurGR or disappointing like Burger Bar. However, I read in their description about how they are all organic and I had to give this place a try!\n\nFirst off, the decor is really modern with colorful drawings of the astronaut cows. Very chic and modern, pretty much the standard at the Cosmo. Here were a couple of things we ordered:\n\nGold standard- 4/5- Really solid burger. The bacon blended perfectly with the sirloin patty.\n\nRising Sun- 4.5/5- This burger is an amazing combination of kobe beef with tempura avocado. Super tasty.\n\nSmores milk shake- 4/5- This shake was amazing! However, it was dang expensive, $13 for a small shake! However, a little indulgence never hurts.\n\nOverall, our hostess was super nice. However, they seemed to be understaffed and I had to yell out to them to get their attention. I would rank this place miles above burger bar but under Gordon Ramsay's."
58,60,1,8161,"Stopped by for dinner before seeing Penn & Teller at the Rio last week. It was my first visit to this location, so I was surprised to see such a small one in a food court. Great sandwiches as usual, though. Can't go wrong with their Ham & Swiss."
21,22,1,1224,The staff here is the best.  Always friendly and great service. The food is always reliable.
43,49,1,7144,Love love love Yogurtland. Great rotation of flavors. Always hits the spot. Only drawback is that it can get reallybusy and the seating area isn't that big. In warmer weather you can sit outside though.
262,299,1,971,"I really don't have much of a sweet tooth, but when I have a craving for something sweet and delicious, I gladly make the 40+ mile round trip for LuvIt custard. \n\nPay no attention to the flavor list on the big menu board- just use it as the pricing guide. The daily flavors are posted on the left side of the order window. They have vanilla and chocolate every day along with 2, sometimes 3 daily flavors. The flavors of the day are also listed on their website for weeks and weeks in advance, so you can plan in advance for your favorite daily flavors. They also offer hand packed cartons (pints, quarts...) to go. \n\nAround the holidays they offer their pumpkin custard which is SO fabulous. I will usually order a quart to have on for a yummy holiday treat.  Besides the pumpkin, my favorites are butter pecan, mint chip, wild cherry, peanut butter, and rocky road. My husband's \""""go-to\"""" treat is the Western Special. \n\nYeah, it's a bit spendy (@ $3.50 for a massive single scoop in a waffle cone); however, all the custard is made in-house daily with high quality ingredients. You'd spend the same, if not more, for factory-made ice cream from Cold Stone."
219,237,1,4385,"yeah, I'll throw my 2 cents in...\nI was here on a Saturday evening around 7 pm and it was PACKED. 40 minute wait for a table for 2, not terrible but I should have made reservations.\nGot right up to the bar and after glancing at a line of drafts 30 foot long, I ordered something I was familiar with because there was no way I was going to try and look at each one and look like a complete tool...anyway the bar service was fast.\nWe ended up getting sat outside, which we didn't ask for but hey, I was starving so we sat, ordered and food got there in decent time. I ordered the beef dip and is was phenomenal. I got the salad instead of fries and it was actually pretty good. I was expecting iceburg lettuce with an under ripe cherry tomato but it was much better than that.\nAll in all, I'd go back just to sample the beer and grab that beef dip again. I take a star off because it felt too touristy for me...I'm more of a locals only dude"
104,109,1,965,"See Richard, my important piece of advice. He is not the eye doctor but he guided me through my out-of-state benefit coverage when my insurance is about to expire, and took the extra time to check and compare my old prescription glasses to my new one, and eventually discovered that the former helped me see better so i had to be refracted and tested again by the clinic's two doctors. This is the type of customer service that earns a customer, and with that, i highly recommends their services."
41,45,1,9363,Welcome to the best hidden boba shop in the clutter of china town! Fresh fruit instead of syrup makes this the go to place!! Add an order of dumplings and you are set! Top notch !
11,11,1,5928,Pretty good dim sum for in a hotel!
25,27,1,6157,Went to a few jewelry stores and even though they didn't have a sale they had the best price by $100.
216,231,1,5863,"I have been very happy with Dawg Days.  The outside is not attractive but the inside is very dog friendly.  We've been taking our dog to get his hair cut there for over a year.  We used to take him to Pet Smart, who nicked him with the razor on 2 occasions and sent us home with a bleeding dog and not a word of explanation.  Dawg Days is family owned, and they genuinely care about the dogs, and when our dog gets nervous, they don't traumatize him.  We just got a second dog and he was terrified of the razor, so they gave him a haircut by HAND and didn't charge us any extra.  They keep the dogs in an open pen indoors and don't lock them in metal crates.  The staff is frequently in with the dogs giving them love and attention.  Our dog is afraid to walk into Pet Smart, but in the last year has never become afraid of Dawg Days, and has never come home bleeding.  It's hard, but don't judge this place by the outside, we have been very happy with their services."
102,111,1,8923,"Leslie does an amazing job every time I go. I have referred her to all my family and friends.  She is always prompt. I never wait past my appointment time, which I appreciate.  The lashes last longer than any other place I have tried, a full three to four weeks.  I never have that weird stingy feeling or any irritation.  It's relaxing, enjoyable, and worth every penny.  I was a mascara addict before, now I just wake up and go!\n\nHighly recommend."
88,95,1,7331,"Can't speak on the food but the drinks are to die for! I had my first mint Julep, done to perfection here, as well as a specialty drink, the lucky ray, a mix of wine & peach schnapps, which I really enjoyed but would have liked in something other than a martini glass considering it was $11. However, being in town square, this was a pretty good price for a drink whatever the glas size."
144,168,1,6973,"Really nice dinner.  Out of our 6 or so meals at Wynn/Encore during our weekend getaway, this was the nicest one.  The watershow is fun and entertaining, a different show occurs every 30 minutes.  I thought the food was very good.  I had the Sauteed Scallops and it was really REALLY good.  I traded one with a friend for a piece of his tuna.  I kind of regret not hoarding my scallops though!  All of us in our party loved the meal.  It did take a while for us to get our food and that was surprising because it did not appear to be crowded.\n\nDessert was great.  I opted for a small piece of the turtle bar thingy and it did not disappoint."
168,196,1,5060,"My new favorite takeaway.  We've lived on the the southside of Edinburgh for nearly two years and somehow had overlooked Noor.  Our loss!\n\nNoor provides an outstanding product, with good customer service, at very reasonable prices.\n\nSaag paneer is my very fave curry, so that's how I judge most Indian places.  Their's is superb -- just spicy enough and the spinach not pureed.   Great pakora and naan.  The chicken korma is very mild.  Working our way through  the menu.\n\nOn the last visit I had placed a large order that was not ready when I arrived to collect it.  A tech glitch had prevented the order from being uploaded and I had to wait about 20-30 minutes.  Without asking, 20% was deducted from the total and a 2 litre of coke added.  Very thoughtful."
101,117,1,8276,"My first experience with WF and I am so in love...never knew I could be swayed from my dear Earthfare but this place is mega and I just couldn't believe how much cheaper my specialty products were compared to EF.  The food was amazing, the fresh juices were amazing, and the smoothies we're amazing!  They have a wine bar, and they carry products of local businesses, have a play area for kids and several areas to lounge around, and valet parking.......what's not to love?"
95,107,1,4521,"This is as good as it really gets, for Japanese cooked food.\n\nYou can get sashimi, at many restaurants, that give some wow factors all over the place.  But it's rare to find a Japanese restaurant, that serves omakase that really tailor to what you like, what you've ordered, so it doesn't give you the duplicates.\n\nReservation is required, reserve early, so you don't eat your dinner at 10:30."
45,52,1,1921,"Gandhi is awesome. Please don't take my word for it, go try their fish tikka and fish pakora and I bet you you'll fall in love with it. This comes from a foodie who loves authentic fish!"
124,132,1,5695,"I'm not the biggest burger fan, which may be why I am hesitant to give five stars. That being said, their unique burger combinations are SO good and the burgers are always juicy. They have a great beer selection, and good Bloody Mary and mimosa specials on Saturdays and Sundays. Service has always been good. I wish there were more options than burgers and salads though, as you are slightly limited if you're not in the mood for a burger. But if that's the case you should probably not go to a burger joint! Have yet to try their breakfast, but am really looking forward to it!"
139,156,1,5377,"This is one of our favorite places to go for sushi. The head chef is so friendly and will create rolls just for us (ask for the Tuna on Fire MANNY style!!!) and the service has always been fast and friendly. We've held large parties there, and our waiters/waitresses always remember what our favorite dishes/drinks are.\n\nI'm so sorry others haven't had the same experiences that we've had over the year. But I couldn't imagine going anywhere else. This is coming from a person who hated sushi before I tried their calamari, salmon skin and tuna on fire rolls. \n\nJust sent my husband to go pick up our take out order. ;)"
51,53,1,107,Monday night drink specials and an amazingly musical performance will be provided to you with a 5 dollar cover.. What more could you ask for?\n\n\nThis building breeds history and I was proud to experience it my last night in Charlotte.
370,406,1,6862,"When I review on yelp, I try to consider all aspects of the experience - the cuisine, of course, is front and center, but other aspects of the experience, such as d\u00e9cor, or ambiance, or service, are also hugely important.  \n\nThat is why I appreciate businesses such as the brand-new Orient House on Park St., who invited us to sit down and eat despite the fact that we'd wondered in, like jackasses, about 10 minutes before they were to close.  In spite of offering to get our stuff for take-out, we were instead taken to a table in the front of the house and our food - crab ragoon, veggie and regular egg rolls, egg drop and sweet and sour soup, and pepper garlic beef, arrived quickly, hot and delicious.  The food was absolutely excellent, and the egg rolls were clearly handmade.  The egg drop soup, often easily mistaken for warm snot at most crappy Chinese joints, was rich and flavorful, and the sweet-and-sour was brimming with mushrooms and tofu and spicy hot.  The beef dish was amazingly fragrant, the peppers, garlic and black bean sauce combining in a wonderful aroma that worked in harmony to flavor the tender beef.  All of this ten minutes before they closed.  We couldn't believe it.\n\nWe look forward to visiting again and trying items off the not-so-secret \""""Chinese-only\"""" menu they have.  For now, the stuff on the menu they give to everybody is pretty awesome.  \n\nThe ambiance is a bit lacking, but at normal dinner hours with a full house I'm sure things are much better.  We noticed that the clock in the shape of Vietnam must be a holdover from the restaurant that occupied this space up until recently.\n\nThanks, Orient House!  You won two more fans."
102,116,1,1569,"I couldn't help but to notice how many middle-eastern people of many different regions are eating here. When eating any type of ethnic food, even Mexican, I want to see a ton of people of that particular ethnicity eating and enjoying the food. First time there a while back and it was delicious and of course the portions are generous. The lamb is money as long as you don't want it burnt...the rice with raisins, dates and lentils was a surprise and the fresh naan...hellyeah!!!"
25,36,1,2954,Great food..great service....great decor....very pleased with the sage fried chicken and bacon waffles..the best..
28,29,1,8636,Very unique fusion restaurant.  Got to try many things I have never had before and combinations I never thought would work but were excellent.
105,123,1,7001,"I ordered the corn beed sandwich with a side of poutine. For those who don't know what poutine is, it is fries with cheese curds with gravy on top. IT'S AMAZING!\n\nThe sandwich was delicious. I know I said I would never have corn beef again but I couldn't understand the girl since she was speaking in French. I pointed at the picture and asked for poutine on the side. \n\nAwesome combo!\n\nOverall, I give it a corn beef high kick!"
6,6,1,5422,Always the best.
54,66,1,9681,"Yum!  They have huge rolls that are just delectable.  A bit pricey and I wasn't as impressed with the non-sushi entrees.  However, the sushi is awesome!\n\nI would recommend getting an appetizer and just jumping straight into the sushi heaven."
148,172,1,8578,"If you like high quality sushi this place is for you. Don't get me wrong, it is pricey. But if you're in Las Vegas it's worth it to enjoy a nice dinner. The ambiance is beautiful with the chandeliers, tables, and chairs. The windows on one side overlook the pool. Everything we had was amazing. We had a few sushi items as appetizers including the albacore sashimi with crispy onions and soup. My entr\u00e9e was the sea bass, which was cooked to perfection. The desserts were unbelievable, we had a combination of three different ice creams and fruit with shaved ice, which was prepared at the table. The staff were very courteous and respectful. I definitely recommend Andrea's if you enjoy fine dining."
6,7,1,2724,Damn fine BBQ.
61,67,1,4294,"Love the happy hour! Cocktails are strong and good.  My girlfriends and I go here all the time, always a great time!  Love Wednesdays, ladies drink 50% off all night, fits my pocket book. Ask for the lady VIP card at the hostess stand, love me a free drink!"
40,46,1,1740,Very tranquil place to eat with a beautiful patio. The menu has a variety so no problem finding something that you'd like. Just right portions and can't beat the complimentary Champagne with brunch.
32,38,1,700,Arribas is great! The chips are fresh and both salas and the bean dip are delicious. I had the white sands chimichanga - it was so good!
79,85,1,7173,"Beautiful breakfast this morning! Everything is so fresh and tempting. In the end, I went for the Bircher muesli and was not disappointed. The coffee is of a good standard as well...something I find hard to come by, having lived away from Melbourne for a year now.\nI am planning to go back for lunch at some stage during my Edinburgh visit. The sandwiches looked amazing!"
146,170,1,8011,"Well now this place has the title if \""""BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN SCOTLAND\"""" and by heck it still lives up delicious meals and great service! \n\nIt's a great asset Tk have in Bonnyrigg as you can sit with your girls zany giggle the night away whilst indulging in home cooked meals and the wine glass constantly being refilled. \n\nIt's great value for the quality and there is so much choice. Don't go for a pizza though as the other dishes would be a crime to miss! \n\nThe service is fast and friendly and always on hand to help with any questions or tough choices with what dish to have! \n\n\""""I will be  back\"""" as Arnold so put it!"

62,64,1,1018,"My brother, his girlfriend and I went here and were so impressed. The couple who run the center were knowledgeable, friendly and so helpful. They have a true passion for inspiring people to be climbers. As a novice, I found many routes  I enjoyed and challenged me. I highly recommend this gym!"
26,27,1,5452,Delicious! The food is always good and fresh. Don't go during normal lunch hours though as it gets crazy busy!
23,24,1,3522,Kids and I have been here multiple times. Love their sandwiches. Haven't had a bad one yet.
288,306,1,33,"My girlfriend and I were staying downtown for a couple nights and wanted to have a drink close to the hotel. This was the third of three gay bars we went into that night. (we didn't even have a drink at the second one) And it was by far our favorite. Not a lot of female patroons so if you're a lady on the prowl, I would probably go somewhere else. But if you just want to relax in a comfortable, friendly atmosphere with some decent music, this is the place!\n\nThere were two bartenders and we happened to sit on Jeff's side. I'm sure they were both quite capable but Jeff was amazing at making us feel comfortable and chatted with us quite a bit until it got later and business picked up. Even then, he made sure we were taken care of. He's pretty much amazing and has great eyebrows.\n\nI guess there was some craziness and fighting by the door and outside as the night got later but we never saw it and it didn't clear out the whole bar. I would expect a downtown bar to have a few problems and it seemed like they were taken care of efficiently. No strikes there.\n\nWe stuck to beers and the prices were very reasonable considering the downtown location. Apparently happy hour runs until midnight! We were able to both have some drinks on the cheap and listen some good music. Definitely returning whenever we're there again!"
83,88,1,5012,"Better than the reviews say. I've been here 5 times now and every time we go, including during the dinner rush, we've always been seated and served quickly. The music here is great, a good selection of beers, but my favorite is the ahi sliders. Very generous portion of perfectly prepared ahi with just the right amount of spice. I will continue to go back, especially during happy hour."
34,38,1,4681,Excellent Peking Duck and other dishes. Service is no-nonsense but polite and courteous. Highly recommend if you're looking for a solid Chinese restaurant in China Town.
39,44,1,3931,"Latest visit was just me and the boy for a quick pizza which was great. Crispy crust, nice sauce - excellent service as always. Past visits included squash ravioli, great red sauce...."
129,141,1,9165,"Great food and really nice atmosphere. My husband and I love the New York strip. Don't overlook their sides. The mushrooms and braised brussel spouts are really really good. I  can't eat gluten and they have prepared delicious gluten free dishes for me. If you have any diet restrictions I recommend calling in advance or at least telling the waiter to ask the chef about your options. You're not limited to the menu items. They are really great about preparing special request. By the way, they do a nice job with carry out, too. The food is packed well and brought out immediately so it's still hot when I get home."
37,43,1,103,Had the pasta special last night at Mama's and it was unreal.  Pure breast meat chicken bolognese in a tomato sauce with perfectly cooked rigatoni. Chef Drew hits another home run.
100,119,1,330,"Love this place. \n\nThey have a bunch of great little kitchy gifts, sweet-arabilia (candies from \""""yester years\""""), some great wines, and a great deli counter.\n\nA few of my faves to leave w/, or find a table to enjoy at outside if I can, their hot pressed cubano and a coconut cupcake. De-e-a-licious.\n\nIts always crowded here, but if you wait out the line, youll see why."
69,81,1,5958,"I like this location. The employees are really nice, the equipment and counters are always clean, and I only ever get my froyo one way (tart froyo, strawberries, fruity pebbles, yogurt chips, & condense milk) and it's still pretty cheap. No complaints! I try and visit at least once a week with my little sister."
6,7,1,8274,Best tacos in Arizona
141,156,1,292,"A friend of mine referred me to Dr. Zeman and I'm SO happy she did. I had this knee scoped back in 06 from another ortho doc in town and it was horrible. This experience is how it should be! I wished I would of known Dr. Zeman back then. I probably wouldn't be in this situation again if I had!  Dr. Zeman scoped my knee  Nov 2, 2011 and removed a 2 cm cyst and cleaned up the meniscus. I can't tell you how happy I am with not only Dr. Zeman but also his entire staff. I feel like I'm in really good hands and I know I am getting the best care possible. They actually really do care!"
60,74,1,6409,"Hooray, downstairs is finally open!! The basement is quiet & cosy with ample seating. The bar isn't open down here yet so you wait for your drink before heading down but that's no biggie when the lattes are so fabulous!\nThe chirpy staff are the icing on the carrot cake :-)"
177,212,1,333,"I love Postino. I just wish it was closer. It's a great place to go after work with a few friends for drinks, but then I gotta drive home...  The $20 deal for wine and bruschetta is as good as everyone says. The prosciutto with figs bruschetta is so delicious, the salty flavor of the prosciutto combined with the sweetness of the figs is heavenly. I also love the smoked salmon and pesto combination. If you're a little hungrier and want something to yourself, the paninis are extremely satisfying. My favorite is the Autostrada, it's spicy and savory and a little bit different from any panini I've had anywhere else. The wine selection could be better, but the truth is if you're drinking out and it's not a special occasion, most people are going to want a decent house wine and leave it at that, and Postino's house wines are just fine."
12,12,1,5281,Love the specials. The Cuban is the best.
105,120,1,2458,"Hmmm....I must of have hit them on a very good day, because we thought the food was really good! We were there between lunch and dinner, so no sloppy drunks around. Ok, so we only had the appetizer platter, but everything on it was delicious and had some unique tastes. They make their own tortillas and you could really tell the difference in flavor and texture. Yes, everything was overpriced, but that seems to be the norm now for Vegas. Oh yeah, the mango margarita was mucho bueno!"
38,40,1,7961,"Wow is about all I can say. Great service and fantastic food, everything we had was top notch. Try the Beef Wellington, it's their signature dish and it's fantastic."
35,36,1,1758,I was very happy with the service of this company. The Jet ski rental was great and performed to its full potential.  Very happy and will rent from them again.
7,9,1,3016,Best happy hour around!!!
126,134,1,789,"So I'm strolling along the mall and I come upon this store.  I looked around a little before leaving, but something caught my eye and I kept it in mind for the return pass through.\nI went back in and was helped by Jennifer, who couldn't have been nicer, more knowledgeable or helpful.\nAfter her recommendation on a few scents, we put together a package that she wrapped nicely.  She told me about their return policy, which includes the recipient returning a scent if not satisfied, even without the receipt.  Very nice. I felt much better about buying something here.\nWhat a great little store."
18,20,1,3771,Nicest ladies run dry cleaners. Perfectly dry cleaned clothes.Always ready on time.
54,60,1,2075,"Outstanding!!!  Great food and lots of it.  Now, the place isn't the prettiest place on earth, but the food is great, the service excellent, the price is great, and i'll go back anytime.  The B & G are great and huge!"
46,48,1,8681,"Vic is awesome. I have used him to set up my home 7.1 surround sound system and car audio. Always on time, very dependable and easy to get a hold of through phone or email. Highly recommended."
32,36,1,3605,I didn't go zipling but I got to see Larry Hernandez live. Who the hell is he? I'm not sure but I had hella fun.
95,102,1,6309,"Met up with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday and we had a great time! Our waiter was friendly and fun--even buying birthday boy a shot of tequila! Gotta love that! Food was enjoyable though not anything you haven't had before but it was satisfying enough and the drinks were kept full. Can't beat that! The mariachi band was EXCELLENT and a lot of fun. It's a little pricey but then, what isn't on the strip anymore?"
105,112,1,4847,"My boyfriend and I were planning to go to the other Middleton location, but with the Good Neighbor Festival in high swing, it was a mad-house in the area, so we traveled down the beltline to this location.\n\nThey offer pretty much the same goods and wares as the other locations, but they also have ICE CREAM. If you know me, I just have to give an extra star to any place that has munchies, great coffee, a good wine selection, and ice cream , to boot!"
43,46,1,7015,"We had a great experience.  The lobster Mac was awesome, the service was great and the burgers were huge.  Great food.  The only thing I will say is the seats in the bar area were hard."
125,135,1,6424,"Best solution in Phoenix for Mid Century items.  They have an ever changing but always diverse selection of finds.  You have to act quick if you find something you want!\n\nThe prices are decent given the condition, they typically have repaired/reupholstered any items on the floor and they're usually willing to work with you a bit on the price.\n\nWindow shopping this place on a regular basis is a lot of fun!  Customer service can sometimes be hit or miss but I've never had major issues.  They even helped me by driving some pieces over to my house that wouldn't fit in my car!"
206,231,1,3853,"5 stars for a simple market and deli with some killer good freshly prepared food.\n\nI've been coming here for years.  I find the portions to be reasonable, and the quality of the food top notch.  Go to the counter, place  your order, and they'll call you up to do a pick up when it's ready.\n\nNothing like going in for a quick lunch and walking out with a bunch of grocery items, a chunk of feta, a pound of tabbouleh, and a bag of freshly baked pita breads.\n\nI'm a fan of their food overall.  There are excellent options for vegetarians.  They also make outstanding stuffed grape leaves.  True story- during one of my pregnancies I craved these, and went twice a week to get them.  They are as good now as they were then.\n\nThere is seating here, so you can go with a small group and have lunch easily.\n\nDon't forget to pick up some freshly prepared baklava for dessert!"
20,23,1,603,"Cant beat it for a $5 lunch.  Great pizza, very fast service, clean establishment."
98,103,1,500,One of my favorite places to shop at! Their food is amazing and a lot of their stuff you can't find at your local grocery store. They have quality flower bouquets that are cheap. I love how they have little shopping carts so that your children won't be bored and can help you out. I obviously know that if I go on a weekend it will be busier than going on a weekday. It shouldn't be such a surprise since its like that everywhere else you go.
40,43,1,1175,"Good greasy spoon.  Quick and Cheap breakfast even on the weekends.  Don't expect anything fancy, but for the price and the fact that it's walking distance, it's hard to beat."
84,88,1,7671,Stopped in on way back home from Prescott. Wanted takeout and Was super hungry 10 min before they closed on a Sunday night. They treated me like I was their first customer of the day. Sat me down at bar while I waited. Served me water and snacks. Food came up quick and away I went. First rate for service and attitude.  I have had the food before so I know it's great.
20,28,1,6160,Friendly faces.  Fast service.  No PUSHY salesmen.  New location on McQueen is easy to find
289,336,1,6947,"Tasty! Very tasty! Ok so I've never been to the East Coast and I'm an Arizona Native so the only comparison for this burger joint is other burger joints in the valley. \n\nThe burger is actually a double, you order the toppings individually, and they have the standards. They make it in front of you which is nice. The pattys were tasty and the buns were some of the best on a burger i've ever had!! Fries were good as well.\n\nWe ordered two burgers, one side of fries and one drink and the total was $18.xx. Expensive? Well it's more expensive than McDonalds of course but not more than a restaurant, it's a good middle ground. I think you pay for the quality. I definitely don't mind paying extra for a great tasting quality burger! \n\nThe decore was......um....interesting. Pretty white everywhere. Peanuts as an appetizer?!? And on the wall was non-local reviews. I rather have local reviews but that's all minor. I went to get a good tasting non-fast food chain burger and that's what I got. I'm happy, and will be returning, probably several times. \n\nFYI-If they had alcohol, they would have gotten 5 stars from me. (It'd be nice for \""""fast food, sit down joints\"""" to take a page out of the Chipotle handbook) umk that's all."
48,50,1,5703,Great spot for a quick bite to eat. I always go with the Carmel chicken and fried rice. It hasn't failed me yet. The only downside is that the parking is pretty tight and it gets quite busy around dinner time.
192,259,1,2252,"I am a huge fan of Bobby Flay so I thought I would love this place. I went here for Brunch and I was right, I loved it. In my group of 5 we all had the Spicy Bloody Mary which was good. How can you go wrong right? \n\nApps: GOAT CHEESE\""""QUESO FUNDIDO\"""", SOPHIE'S CHOPPED SALAD (2), SMOKED SALMON + DI L L QUESADILLA, SWEET POTATO SOUP. The Goat Cheese Fundido was the best out of all the app choices, but all still good.\n\nEntree:  SPICY SCRAMBLED EGGS, RANCH STYLE EGGS TOSTADA, BLUE CORN BUTTERMILK WAFFLE, MESA BURGER (2). My favorite was the Spicy Eggs, holy smokes, I can taste them now. Everyone loved their entrees and demolished the food.\n\nBe sure to make a reservation for any meal you plan on eating here. Oh and P.S. the bread basket is oh so good. You will be wanting more."
100,110,1,2663,"When my family and I rolled into Vegas, we stopped here first.  After a longish, hot drive from LA, you can imagine how we felt when we paid up and stepped into the dining and buffet area.  My siblings stopped dead in their tracks as they took in the glory.\n\nI did my best to pace myself, but I still ponied up to the buffet FIVE TIMES.  Yes, five. We were kind of hurting for a while.  That means that it was great."
57,58,1,4770,I've always been impressed with the service at this location. The wait staff is always super friendly and always quick when you need something. The food is amazing every time. The endless shrimp and lobster fest deals get me coming back every year when I see the commercials on TV.
101,115,1,95,"Mimosa is fantastic. I went there for lunch recently for my friend's birthday. I had the best cheeseburger I've ever had in my life. It was topped with bacon and cheddar cheese, but the burger itself was just seasoned perfectly. Mm mm. It is on the pricey side, but it's definitely more reasonably priced for lunch, so I'd recommend checking it out then. As other Yelpers have said, it's just one of those restaurants where everything you order is likely to be good."
64,72,1,4564,"Awesome place!  Dr. Remen and staff are friendly, compassionate and professional.  You know they care about the animal and the owner.  Marge, the groomer, is great.  You know your pet is in gentle hands with her.  I've been to many, many veterinary hospitals and this is by far the best!"
50,59,1,8584,Backyard Taco was serving at the Johnson Elementary Carnival. The food was fantastic and grilled right before us. Really enjoyed the carne asada and pollo street tacos. Everyone was raving about their food. One parent was raving about her papa loca. NICE!
19,22,1,655,"great stake as any other high end stake house, anything special ... I dint think so"
22,25,1,1123,Great diner food! I recommend the hanlons handful for breakfast! Great price and right amount of food.
153,186,1,2254,"Does not disappoint! It's a grill with a kick! Tiger shrimp is succulent and tamale side buttery, moist, sweet corn. The cheese appetizer is also delicious. Both the pork tenderloin and ribeye are top-notch, spicy, sweet, perfectly seared. The buttery sweet potato tamale with pecans is awesome! Better than the side of blue corn basil tamale. Even the bread basket is awesome - chili asiago cheese, walnut raisin, blue cornbread... Yummy. We had some chocolate pudding that was delicious, creamy milk chocolatey. Service is friendly, helpful and responsive. My son loves the cheese quesadillas they will make for kids. My baby was grunting in delight for spoonfuls of the mashed potatoes - I think she had 1/2 of my husband's side to herself!"
16,17,1,248,Must have been an off day last time. These partners are phenomenal!
51,57,1,6584,"I love Sambalatte.  This is just what Vegas needed.  It is a beautiful, relaxing place with great tea and a wonderful staff.  Great place to hang out working on your computer, for a business meeting or for an outing with friends and family."
186,213,1,4032,"Best Sandwiches I've had in my life!!!! My friend and I came here after a crazy weekend. We heard about how good this place was from other people. As soon as we got there we knew it must be good cause there was a loooong line!! About 30min later we ordered what we wanted. I ordered the Tuna Melt and the Caribbean Jerk Chicken. My friend got the Meatball one and the Tuna Melt. After waiting anxiously for our sandwiches, our order was finally ready. I took my first bite into the Tuna Melt and it was so freaking good I almost cried. Crunchy warm toasted bread, soft flaky tuna with perfectly gooey melted cheese. Best Tuna Melt ever!!!!! The Caribbean Jerk Chicken was pretty good too but nothing compared to that perfect Tuna Melt. Earl of Sandwich..... I will never have a sandwich elsewhere. Definitely coming back whenever I'm in Vegas!! Hopefully this time I won't lose money on my way in..."
26,30,1,5204,I just can't get enough of their Nicoise Salad. And their fries and desserts are great. Need I say more!!
112,133,1,4775,"Cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me experience!\n\nThe 5 for $6 happy hour at the bar is nothing short of fantastic.  What does 5 for $6 exactly mean?  As I found out, it means they have 5 options of food or drinks for $6 each.  Happy hour ends at 7pm.\n\nThe drinks and food are superb.  I tried the burger and brie puff and they were very tasty and filling.  The service was also exemplary.\n\nI am an instant fan of Fleming's and will be a return customer."
249,284,1,5130,"Ok, so I'm no expert on cajun food, at all.  To be completely honest the only experience I've had are through Anthony bourdain on the travel channel and a botched birthday meal at papa deaux.  After stumbling upon this place on yelp while at work, it was all I could do to not call out for the rest of the day and satisfy my craving for dirty rice right then.  When I did get off I grabbed my hubby and drove all the way to Avondale.  He ordered the sausage po boy, with cajun chips and cole slaw, and I had the Friday special, it was shrimp in a gravy over rice, dirty for me, I have no idea what it was called.  The shrimp was amazing, the spicy smoky flavors over the dirty the dirty rice hit the spot.  ITs a good thing mine was so good or my fianc\u00e9 would have had to fight me for his po boy, that sausage was to die for.  I love the cole slaw, but thought the chips were so so, He loved the chips and thought the cole slaw was so so.  The employees were friendly the prices were good.  The decor was... colorful...  Overall, big fan.\n\nP.S. Beer would be nice."
97,105,1,4981,"We enjoyed our stay at this modern hotel in Leith.\n\nOur room was spacious and comfortable - quite stylish beyond the typical chain hotel.\n\nWe ate both breakfast and dinner there, thoroughly enjoying both. The salmon Benedict was particularly tasty.\n\nThe service was very good with a friendly and helpful staff.\n\nWhile the neighborhood has some nice restaurants and pubs, the hotel is 10-15 minutes taxi ride from the Castle and Royal Mile."
93,98,1,9469,"This place is awesome! First off, they have a huge selection of supplies, including odds & ends that you can use for art projects. It's really fun to just create stuff with weird items and doesn't cost much at all. There is also local artist's art on the walls and rooms in the back of the building that you can purchase or simply stare at. If anything, it's worth a visit just to see what an inspiration looks like :)"
36,37,1,5874,"I like this place. The brick house burger is really good, the service is good as well. I like  its corn bread very much although it's just a side dish"
11,11,1,4765,Excellent and you can bring your own wine.
16,16,1,6112,Awesome Salon! New Owners cleaned it up and have a great staff!
26,30,1,7811,"Possibly my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area.  The tacos are delicious, and the coconut margarita is a highlight as well."
59,68,1,9127,"Pizza was on point! Chewy crust, fresh mozzarella and delicious topping! Sausage & mushroom and vingole will not disappoint. Manager stopped by the table to personally thank us and check in which was a nice touch. Good atmosphere, a nice addition to the Arcadia neighborhood- I will be back!!"
121,127,1,4850,"Absolutely love it. The owners are so nice, service is always awesome and the food is fantastic. We almost always get the Brick Oven pizza which is dotted with fresh mozzarella, homemade sauce, basil, olive oil and spices. Comes out piping hot with a thin but not too-thin crust that's like heaven. No wait, actually the side order of vodka sauce we order to dip our crust in is heaven. I haven't had any pizza in Charlotte and surrounding that can even come close to this. SO awesome. Think I will have to go there this week after thinking about that pizza!!"
17,18,1,4273,Good service and above average pizza. Felt welcome and treated us like locals.
86,102,1,7601,"Hubby took me here last night as a late V-day gift...The atmosphere was really nice. Very romantic. Our waitress was outstanding! The food was also good. I had the bbq steak, baked potato & green beans w/ a Sagria on the side. Kinda pricy and I flt like I could have the smae meal at BJs for less but I'm a fan. Would definetly go back (around a payday)!!!"
58,61,1,3753,"Fresh made pasta in a cozy neighborhood strip mall. I wasn't expecting the quality of the food to be so good. It's a bistro atmosphere with friendly service. They have good lunch specials and the place is busy. Dinner, especially on a week night, was more quiet."
69,75,1,9356,Great little spot on the Strip. Cheap drinks. Beer pong tables in the back as well as fast food spots. Very conveinent after beer pong. Nice casual bar crowd & beer pong attracts younger crowd from everywhere. Live music. Some reviews are saying that it is closing down. Just when I find a great place for the common folk.
55,58,1,1576,"This is actually a Shell gas station with a CircleK convenience store. I like this Gas station because it's never crowded, has a lot of pumps, and it's convenient to get to. The Market is always clean and has a fairly good beverage/coffee station."
53,60,1,5309,"Staying at VDARA this weekend made our Vegas experience 100xs better!! Everything about our two bedroom penthouse suite was amazing!! Plus, the fact that the resort is 100% non-smoking was an added bonus! Will definitely stay in the VDARA family resorts moving forward!"
45,48,1,1402,"Pretty surprising for a sports bar. Excellent variety, higher end quality and consistency with everything we've tried here! Even their steamed veggies are amazing. Try their honey medium spicy wings! Bomb! Great service and drinks."
66,69,1,7129,What a great place! I walked right in was greeted at the door. We told them it was our first time here. I was offered a beer and a seat. Their hummus was home made and awesome. Everyone here was super attentive and very nice. Just an all around good night. Will for sure be back.
69,71,1,9516,"I have been here many times and anything I ever tried was awesome, can't go wrong here with any coffee beverage you may want. The reason why I couldn't give it 5 stars is that every time i tried to get a seat outside, was not possible, other than that I can say that I always go there with pleasure."
77,91,1,2982,"Who doesn't like ice cream?  \n\nThe best part about staying on the 'other' side of vegas in the California hotel was stumbling upon the ice cream shop.  I must have squealed that I did not know Lapperts was here!!!\n\nAnyway, doesn't matter if you're too full from your meal or too drunk, stumble in and let your taste buds rejoice."
15,19,1,3597,"Great steaks, salads, ambiance, decor. Highly recommend coming."
11,11,1,3621,Great place for suits and a great price.
118,127,1,7937,"Went here during a buffet night. I was very happy to find that they accept BitCoin, yay! Its just too bad I didn't have any in my BlockChain account lol. The food was decent, but a little bit bland at the same time. I would probably give them 4 stars, but I didn't have a reservation and they slid me right in, so they really deserved the extra start for going above and beyond.\n\nI would definitely stop here again, but I'm also not sure when the buffet typically takes place. I know its just once per month."
85,88,1,8513,I did not remember what I ate the last time I was at the pub and was not too excited about eating their again. But it turned out to be one of the most memorable dinner at Caesars Palace during this visit to Las Vegas. I had the braised beef cheeks that melted like butter and paired with Lucky Beer. The service was great and friendly. Can't wait to go back and eat at the restaurant again.
76,85,1,9440,"Service A+, decor very nice, Bul Gogi and side dishes = Phenomenal.\nCan't wait to go back. These guys know how to put out top quality Bul-Gogi! Super fresh rib-eye beef.  What a treat to have them open up a few months ago, truthfully the best Korean Food in Arizona, look no further, you will not be disappointed!"
49,57,1,2554,"it is a great restaurant. International cuisine, great Salads ans stakes.\nexelent Brekfast and buffet every morning till 11:00 am\n\nit is very safe and fast to eat here. you are not going to get sick."
301,330,1,2358,"One of my favorite hotels in Las Vegas... Been fortunate enough to stay here on many occasions throughout the years so I think I know the hotel well enough to review it.\n\nThe rooms are nice and spacious. All suites. So that means an LCD TV in the sleeping area, one in the sunken living area which includes a pull-out sofa bed, desk and another small LCD in the bathroom. Staying at the newer towers in the hotel (away from registration) are a lot better just because the beds, bathrooms, etc. are nicer and the guest elevators are closer to the shops, food court and casino.\n\nThe Venetian pools are great and you have the option of using the Palazzo pools because they are connected by a short walkway. Both pools are great. Venetian has Tao beach for people that want the club experience in the daytime.\n\nVenetian also has the nightclub TAO in the front of the hotel. This has probably been the most popular longstanding club (5 years) on the Strip and it still gets as packed as ever. DJ Skratchy or DJ Vice keep it happening and are my favorites for movin the crowd. Packed is not the word for this place. The Venetian has a decent \""""cheap\"""" food court and a better food court on the casino level that has good late night pizzas and Italian food. There's also a Grand Lux cafe on the casino level. Good food and big portions there.\n\nLove the Venetian. Always have always will..."
127,154,1,7468,"Seriously the best dinner I've had in a very long time.  Three of us dined this past Monday night and it was a bit slow so we rec'd extra special attention from the waiter.\n\nWe had the fried burrata and crisp pancetta wrapped prawns.  So yummy and succulent.  Let me talk about the baby beet salad. OHMYGAWD!  I will dream of this special salad forever.  I've never seen orange beets but simply de-lish.  Also, we had the scallops, salmon, and claim pasta.  Just gorg food and ever so good.\n\nI absolutely love this place.  Go.  There.  Now."
163,172,1,2868,"KC had been to the social house before, but this was my first time. The ambiance is nice, with a dimly lit dining area and friendly waiters. Apparently, the hot thing to do there is to let the waiters bring you food until you're full. Though the food they bring out is good, don't expect it to be cheap. When the bill arrived, I realized that the waiter had done double orders on some of our dishes, especially the expensive ones. Though the Kobe beef was excellent, we would have been sufficient with 6 pieces instead of the 12 that he brought on a single plate. Also, since we didn't order, all of our dishes came sashimi style. Though it accentuated the flavor of the dishes, I left the restaurant still a bit hungry while my wallet was already dry."
118,123,1,8425,"This restaurant was highly recommended to me and my family, so we decided to try venturing outside of our comfort zone and trying a new restaurant. As the name implies, the menu is mainly focused on meat and pickled items. I had the pork belly that was to die for. My dad had the pork burger - topped with bacon, it seemed like an item from the Heart Attack Grill's menu, but he thoroughly enjoyed it. P&P has a great beer and wine list. Very friendly service and a relaxed atmosphere. We'll be back when we're in the area again!"
149,166,1,144,"My wife's Mini Cooper had to have its engine replaced. She no longer felt comfortable driving that car. We visited Nissan, Honda, Toyota and VW dealerships and ultimately had the best experience with Zimbrick VW in Middleton. Otto was very helpful. He was not pushy and gave us all the information we needed to make a decision.\n\nZimbrick made a very fair offer to trade in the Mini but we ended up selling it ourselves. Once my wife's car was sold, Otto made the process very quick and easy so we had her in her new Passat the same day. He even stayed after closing to walk her through setting up her new car!\n\nWhen I replace my Toyota RAV4, I will definitely consider Zimbrick VW."
72,74,1,9041,Order was right exactly what I asked for and did all online! I was surprised at the late hours on base normally food establishment close at 8. Only down side on line wouldn't allow me to make my order delivery. Had to drive to pick up! They also don't offer as much in there special offers as other stores in the city do.
40,49,1,19,Great shop! Watched them make their waffle comes right in the shop and they are delish!\n\nTried the salted caramel and was surprised to find little chocolate covered caramels inside! Yum!
57,63,1,5550,This is how Carne Asada tacos should be made.  Don't let the exterior deter you.  The owner is super friendly and you can tell she is dedicated to give her customers a great experience. The inside is spotless and the food is spot on!  Keep up the great work.
151,173,1,1111,"Aladdin's is just a solid restaurant. The menu is extensive, it's quick, the wait staff is friendly, and I am never disappointed with my meal. They use very fresh, high quality ingredients. Their baba ganouj and falafel are some of the best I've tried! The falafel is perfectly crispy and fresh, not overdone. I often go here for takeout because they are so quick and reliable. If I do takeout I usually get a rolled pita with hummus or baba and tabouli. My parents love this place as well. My only slight complaint is that sometimes it is a little cold with the AC, but I just have to remember to take a sweater and then I'm fine. The outside seating is also very nice on a summer day!"
88,97,1,5629,"I cried when I heard that the downtown Firefly had closed. Literally. In this hour of sorrow, I can comfort myself with the fact that I enjoyed the chorizo stuffed mushrooms and pitchers of delicious sangria here as many times as I could during this restaurant's short life. Still, it's cold comfort.\n\nRIP Downtown Firefly - let's hope your successor can live up to your high standards. Somehow, I doubt it."
142,165,1,5070,"BEST Creme Brulee in the world.. well at least so far..that I have tried. It had banana and the bottom was lined with chocolate. Pure unadulterated heaven!\n\nCame here via the Urban Spoon App..otherwise I would have probably never stumbled upon this gem. Shrimp cocktail fresh and excellent. Mahi mahi tacos, tasty! Service quick, friendly, efficient. Tiny little place..size of a large living room..walls cluttered with badly framed movie memorabilia and such. 2 Large screen TVs, nice lighting. Its like someone turned the man cave into a dining room. lol.\n\nI will most certainly be back.. if just to force the creme brulee on all that I know."
32,37,1,3656,The food is always fresh and the owners are nice people. The kalbi short ribs are a must. The beef and chicken bulgogi are always on point.
74,80,1,6978,"We have been twice. Both times the food has been excellent and tasty, with fresh ingredients. I have had seafood both times and been very pleased with the quality and preparation. (cioppino is very good) Reasonably friendly staff with decent service. My only complaint was that the waitress this last time really had no knowledge of the wine list and that was really a bummer."
30,33,1,4715,"Simple, well prepared food. Good atmosphere, good service. Heavier and more traditional than the meal we had at Bouillon Bilk the night before."
120,135,1,2210,"The best Thai food I had in long time.  I started with Sa-Tay of chicken.  Very good pickle vegetables and a delicious peanut sauce.  I enjoy it immensely.  My girlfriend had the Tom Yum Kai.  She really enjoyed the soup.  I was lucky and got to try it before she ate it up.  I agree, the soup was great.\nI had the drunken seafood noodles with spice level of 7.  It was spicy but satisfying.  The food was delicious and the spicy sauce was incredible.  We came pretty late but service was still very good.  Definitely, will be back again."
26,28,1,1277,Great subs and great deals at this location. Perfect for student. 15 inches for under $6 and much better than subway.
5,5,1,1458,great service.
99,114,1,135,"The location is right on... across the street from UNCC and next store to Brueggers, I have spent many of nights cramming for a test or getting my caffeine fix before work. Since this Starbucks is very small and always busy you have to keep you eye on a table and pounce when one comes available. The baristas are my favorite in Charlotte, they have pretty much memorized my order. They're speedy and always friendly. Good thing Starbucks is building a larger location in the same shopping center."
66,69,1,1107,"Enrico is a great place for a quality cut. He is busy, and the phone does ring, but in all the many times I've been there he books the guy, hangs up and moves on. Seriously, it's a good hair cut, he listens to what you want, and delivers for a fair price."
13,16,1,6250,Awesome service and food! Gotta get the messy sundae!!!
86,96,1,2684,"Love this place! If you like the idea of mongolian BBQ grill like YC's, then you'll definitely love this place. I love that you can pick what kind of sauce you like, your veggies, and either noodle or rice, and they do the rest! They make sure your food is yummy! They also have a regular menu as well which is also delicious...Definitely inexpensive for the amount of food you get!"
85,91,1,4949,"I was visiting Vegas this weekend, and stepped into Sunrise this morning before heading home, and just to be clear: this place rocks! Baristas knew their coffee, and we're super friendly, I also loved that they roasted their beans in store. Size of shop was small but still comfortable. I will definitely be returning to this coffee house whenever I find myself in Vegas again. Oh, and my cappuccino was great."
20,22,1,3153,"The food is great but a bit salty. Btw, i have had the drunken noodle."
48,51,1,5386,Rented here twice since i been in arizona and both times were in and out had no issues with billing and the staff work to get you processed as they understand your time is valuable i would most definitely use this company over u-haul
61,64,1,1684,"We had a great meal here. The place was packed! The servers were slow initially BUT it was packed and once we were seated, the service was fine. Tons of vegetarian options. The food was well spiced and the portions were sufficient.\n\nI would visit again. 5 stars!"
24,25,1,4686,"Great restaurant! I've never been disappointed. The food is consistently good, and the service is very professional."
82,89,1,9590,"I cannot tell you what makes a good pho good, but I can definitely tell a bad pho from the first sip of the soup. The soup at Pho Lan is authentic with no taste of msg. It is fresh and light. For the price, it is not a huge portion, but it is pretty tasty. I will come back if I ever crave for pho again when I am in Vegas."
256,285,1,4731,"We were glad that we had a reservation!  The restaurant was packed and remained full during our entire time there.  So...make reservations.\n\nNow for the food...\n\nThe restaurant features a modified Open Kitchen format, where behind the glass, one can observe chefs making fresh Naan Bread and chopping a variety of items...activity which provided a source of tremendous curiosity for a little boy at the table besides ours.\n\nWe ordered appetizers, a traditional beef curry, chicken tandori and a chicken curry with bismatti rice.  The Naan Bread was delicious and we enjoyed a trio of dipping sauces.  Our waiter did indicate that they could cook our food to mild or spicy.  Since this was our first experience, we didn't want to risk spicy.  I wish we had.  The meal was blander than I expected.  When I go to an ethnic restaurant, I think that exotic, spicy flavors are the best part of the package.  But, this was my bad...we asked for things to be toned down; probably a bit too much.\n\nService was attentative, albeit a little slow.  As every single table was taken up, this was understandable.  We enjoyed the experience and would not hesitate to go back again.  A pretty solid choice for Indian cuisine."
23,28,1,7094,My son loves their pho!  He is pretty picky but they always make it with no vegtables for him.
120,127,1,8695,"Small location with limited seating. It only accepts cash, and the menu is slightly limited. But the few things I tried, the fried pork over rice, and curry chicken are both delicious and cheap. The fried pork was juicy with a crunch fried outside. The curry was also quite satisfying. The food is slightly on the oilier side, and wouldn't be suprised if there is a bit of MSG in it. In general I would prefer it over the nearby asian competitors: Little Asia, Lulu's Noodles, Oriental Express. But because of the limited menu, I'll visit Little Asia occasionally."
78,85,1,381,Delicious. This was our first visit since Thai Rama has been closed and we were not disappointed.The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The Tom Kah soup was some of the best I've ever had and the lemon infused water was a nice touch. We also had the sweet and sour chicken which was kinda meh but everything else was quite tasty. We will be back for sure.
194,202,1,6939,"I love this place. Although it is way off the strip of Las Vegas, it is still a great place to go. They have one of the best AYCE there for the price you pay. The food there is awesome and the place is nice and clean overall. There are like lounges where you can just sit and enjoy a beverage and enjoy the ambience. The pool area is pretty nice and clean, very comparable to the Venetian pool. The reason why I gave this place 4 stars even though I love this place is because of the rude service I got while playing at a table. I was new to the table and wasnt sure how the rules were, but the dealer just didnt make me want to stay at the table. their rules at the table were different than any other casino i have been to so I wish there was like a sign posted with the simple rules. I almost didnt want to tip the dealer at all but I know that is courtesy of a player"
25,28,1,1147,Excellent lunch. Special peach/bourbon chicken sandwich and the Harvest salad with shrimp and the Chilled cucumber soup were incredible.
16,16,1,4502,Love the little orphans. Great way to taste various cheese for cheap!
88,92,1,8785,"This place is literally 50 feet from where I work. The noodles I ordered were amazing. They were quick to prepare the meal for take out too. You earned a customer, I'll be back for lunch next time! Service was good too, they offered me water while I waited for my food, even as a take out order.\nBasic orders cost 8$, add a few toppings and it can easily add up  to 11$"
130,138,1,108,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this place.  Seeing some of the patrons walking into this place dressed up and at the same time seeing a giant alligator statue sitting in a throne in the front yard.  Once inside it's actually a really nice place.  The service is great, the waitresses are very friendly and attentive and really cared that we had a good time.  There is live music on some nights which always makes for a good time.  Looking at the other reviews, I think the food is kind of hit or miss.  I guess I was lucky with the red beans and rice, it was really good by my standards at least."
114,128,1,9488,"I was craving legit tacos al pastor from the Mexican Riviera and Taco y Taco definitely came through for us! The tacos al pastor were delicious. We also had the Mexican street corn, a novelty - but equally as good! The salsa bar had tons of variety including two tours of ridiculously yummy beans, at least half a dozen salsas, roasted peppers, pickled & fresh veggies. Top it all off with a fully stocked bar and I am sold. We will be coming back for all of our authentic Mexican food fixes. At their low prices, that will be often!"
220,232,1,9355,"Bought general admission tickets for my best friend, and I. Worth every penny! We were in the second row, and I was just a few feet from Godney. You can't go to a Britney Spears concert and expect her to sing live. That's just a stupid move on your part, she's not the one to blame. I had read bad reviews so I was expecting a lot less from the show, but I am a die hard Britney fan so I went and was extremely impressed. You can't expect her to dance how she did 10 years ago. She's in her 30s with 2 children. Also, the dancers were significantly younger than her, so yeah, they are going to be a bit faster. But Britney did all of the moves, and looked like she was enjoying herself. She looked fabulous, and it was one of the best concerts I've ever seen. The outfits and the theatrics were really good. Also, the Axis is a really nice and cool venue. This is a show that's really worth seeing and it made me happy seeing Britney doing so well."
119,125,1,3614,"J2 Cleaning did an outstanding job of cleaning my carpet and floor tile. Charles was absolutely wonderful! Jesse came out to give me a quote and Jeff set up my appointment. Everyone was so pleasant and professional. Mike also stopped by to help stretch my carpet in two rooms. I had several cracked tile and knew they probably would crack again if replaced. Charles used a filler and they look 100% better.  I will never use another company for my carpet and tile cleaning needs, trust me they are the best! I should also mention their rates are more then fair.\n\nMaryellen Amaro"
79,97,1,6948,"Items sold in Artisanal Foods are pretty unique. We bought a bottle of yuzu juice (made in Miyazaki, Japan), some small stuff and even Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s' potato chips, ha! The guy running the shop let us sample many of items and it helped us to decide what we would buy.\n\nNot cheap but worth a visit if you're into quality foods."
69,73,1,5456,"Good hike that gets straight to the point. Went on a holiday so it was pretty crowded. As others have mentioned, this is strenuous and I dont know that a younger child could make it all the way up. My 5 year old made it half the way up before we had to turn back. All in all, still worthwhile."
244,267,1,5282,"Heard a lot of high regard for the place and I figured wife and I would be disappointed and didn't feel like waiting in the line.  Figured it was more hype than actual goodness.  I was wrong.\n\nThe wait was probably 30 minutes, but the beer selection and the ability to get the beers in different sizes made the wait a non-factor.\n\nSat at the bar and the prices were more than reasonable with very laid back friendly service.  Not the world's best BBQ, but very good.  The atmosphere learns a lot to the senses and I enjoyed the meal.  The smoked sweet potato was a perfect side dish.  Rib tips were not the meatiest tips I've had, but very good.  Wife had the brisket and was impressed.  Not too moist, not too dry, the way she likes it.\n\nServing size isn't huge, but enough to fill the belly after some beers.  Definitly a worth while visit.\n\nGreat staff, service, atmosphere, beer, and food.  What else could I ask for, I guess I paid the cheap Urbana parking meter, but I'm sure there is a free lot and I think the parking is free after hours."
28,39,1,4842,"Love, love, love this place! Macaroni & Gravy. Canoli. Pizza. Sfogliatelle. Steve rocks!! It's like home."
101,104,1,3400,"I go to two locations regularly and this location always has the friendliest people working, looks clean, and has a great variety of classes. It doesn't seem as closed in or dark as some of the other locations. No complaints :) The women at the front desk on the evenings I go always seems to be wiping down the doors, windows, desk etc. Which when you consider all the sweating on the machines it is nice to at least have the illusion that everything is being cleaned all the time!"
31,37,1,856,In particular for not being in a great area this place is friggin sweet!  Salsa dynamite. Shrimp was excellent. Great Guac. Solid all around.
65,72,1,5682,"Nice views but not the best. Drinks were pricey but excellently made by warm and very friendly servers.\n\nGreat vibe, good tunes at right volume, and very comfortable seats.\n\nThe nut tray is a plus.\n\nIf i were staying at City Center or Cosmo, id return."
50,59,1,2945,"BACON IN THE WAFFLE!!\n\n\ngenius. \n\n\nits our new tradition now, every time we come to vegas we gotta eat here for breakfast. dont mind the 45 min wait, its well worth it : )"
127,145,1,6069,"My first experience with Culver's was visiting the in-laws in Wisconsin. It was love ever since! Usually drove to the one in Mesa, but now I have one close to home! \n\nBacon double cheeseburger with a side of fried cheese curds is AWESOME! The food is good here. The people are even \""""midwestern\"""" nice and very helpful when you need to navigate the sometimes complex menu. Place is always clean and the icing on the cake is that they have sports on usually on one of the handful of large HD tvs. \n\nThe frozen Custard is a family favorite! 5 Stars for the Custard!"
31,33,1,388,It's a Whole Foods. They are all the same! Which isn't a bad thing for Whole Foods considering the awesome food and product selection!
67,72,1,6649,I decided try this place out because of the good reviews.  This place is hidden in a small plaza.  It was empty when we got there at noon on a sunday.  The food came out fast and The egg rolls were very tasty but i thought the pho was just okay. The food was fresh and the service was good.
168,181,1,8385,"One of the, if not, THE BEST video game store in town.  Definitely worth the drive coming from Scottsdale.\n\nThe Gaming Zone is exactly what their name is.  Very real and unbiased employees, a good selection of used retro titles, and a very clean place that holds tournaments and just plain fun.  Wide selection of video games to play on the spot.\n\nTrading in games for either cash and/or credit is very fair and down to earth.  Unlike other re-sellers or video game stores, The Gaming Zone will give you fair deals for the games you want to sell.  Never had to return a used item from these guys.\n\nOverall, this place is a solid store with solid service and a solid selection.  Did I mention there is an arcade section full of some child hood memories?"
36,37,1,8266,So worth the money.  We ate for 3 hours it was so good and so many option's it was absolutely delicious no matter what you had and the service was superior.
33,36,1,8525,Great food and a really good price. I love the Panini sandwiches and the brownie desserts. So good! This is a great place for lunch or dinner!
28,38,1,2615,This is great quality mexican food.  I've had two dishes from here.  The green chili enchiladas and the Torta...... Great food!
20,24,1,6913,One of my favorite places in Phx. Clost to the house and very clean and freindly.
8,9,1,620,Very good bagels and sandwiches!
60,63,1,7299,One of the coolest places I would've never expected to find in Uptown Charlotte. Feel like I stepped off Church St. and into a little corner of the Emerald Isle. Definitely worth a visit. Grab an irish pint in this cozy pub and enjoy some good darts or soccer on the tv.
31,31,1,1263,"The food and service were great! This is a cozy, intimate place perfect for a date night, but may not work so well for large groups"
29,33,1,9060,I have been here a couple times now.  The breakfast croissants are amazing!  If i lived closer I would be there probably too often.
75,81,1,2119,"I have been a regular here since I relocated 3 years ago.  The staff (Dylan & Billy) are very helpful in finding the right stick for you to smoke. A great selection of sticks, and the monthly Customer Appreciation Day ($10) on selected cigars is a great deal.  The lounge is small, yet comfortable, most folks are friendly and like to talk about cigars."
91,97,1,3997,And then the century old battle of Home Depot vrs Lowes commenced. And.. the girl that was forced to go to both did not see a difference.\n\nI think you grow up with one and just like it?\n\nFor me I love how everyone is helpful and you can be as vague as possible and they can find what you need. thing such as: Hole in wall. Need stuff for the hole. is suffice.
29,35,1,3032,"Nachos are the best,  also, tacos are imaginative.  Highly recommend. Second story on the El Pedregal shopping center, outdoor seating available."
43,44,1,7935,"Great local place. Generous portions, friendly staff. It is small but not crowded and very pleasant atmosphere. Food is simple and well prepared. A must stop if you do not enjoy chain restaurants when you travel"
93,97,1,7211,"A great spot with local beers on tap, live DJs on the weekends, and an interesting array of indie and foreign films. The interior is slightly swanky without being pretentious, and it's usually quiet enough to have a decent conversation. The theater was a bit bigger than I expected based on the size of the bar. Overall, this is a good place to come with your friends, on a date, or even on your own for a beer or three."
273,308,1,2310,"when i first planned our latest LV trip, last August, I was looking for a hotel that was off the strip, but wasn't too far off, so if i wanted to visit places on the strip, i could.\n\nthe first hotel that came up on a search was The Orleans.  I read some reviews and saw pictures and thought \""""why not?\"""".  \n\nmy first impression when we got there was that it looked like a big carnival cruise boat.  i've never been to NOLA, but i've seen pictures and i swear, the hotel looks like it was airlifted from NOLA into LV.\n\ni love this hotel for the amenities.  there are movie theatres upstairs, a couple of buffets and restaurants (tgi fridays, 365 steakhouse, etc.), there's a play structure that heavily guarded by employees if you want to leave your kid there (they do charge, though), iirc, there's a bowling alley too...and to top it all off, the casino is HUGE!\n\nthere's a shuttle that leaves every 10 minutes and takes you to and from across the street from the bellagio hotel.\n\nthe staff is cool and actually credited us with one nights stay since we got there really late the 1st day and they gave our room away.  i'll definitely stay here again next time i'm in LV."
168,184,1,1877,This review is for gambling at the casino only.... I haven't stayed at this place yet but wouldn't mind trying it out either. On the first night in Vegas we ended up at Harrah's after walking down the strip from the Tropicana. After a few peep's from our group wandered off to play a poker tournament I ended up at a crap's table around midnight & stayed until 6 am the following morning when the sun came up. I started with a 40 dollar buy in and at the end of the morning I walked out with just a little over 300 and had a blast in the process. Our dice table was full of people and all of us were having such a blast together even though we were are complete strangers. It was good luck and good times. I will be coming back here to roll the dice again for sure...
118,130,1,9498,"My family has been attending or performing in shows at the Tuscany Theatre in conjunction with AYT since January 2014.  We have been cast in two, helped backstage with one and simply attended another.  Throughout, the experience has been very fulfilling not only for my daughter but also for myself and the rest of my family.  AYT does a wonderful job truly making you feel like family.  I can't see any reason why my family would go anywhere else.  If you are looking for somewhere for a show or for your child to get involved, look no further.  This is where you want to be!"
73,85,1,4671,"There's literally only two reasons to ever go to the Galeries du Parc. One of them is the Cin\u00e9ma du Parc, probably the best rep house in the city, and the Spicy Noodle. Fast, dirt cheap and delicious.  Location's a bit weird, but if you're in the McGill Ghetto area, there's no reason to swing by."
22,25,1,9318,Absolutely fantastic product; the grapefruit is amazing. Exceptional good service every time I've been there too.
46,51,1,9116,"The BEST Sushi in town by far. All others hail in comparison. Head chef Kim is and the staff is very personable. The sushi itself is unbelievable. Best place in town, i've eaten at many sushi places."
84,93,1,9277,"I took my 5 year old son here and this place is awesome!! I got a vanilla iced coffee and it was delicious. I am very picky about the quality of iced coffee drinks. This passed with flying colors. I also ordered a buttermilk donut, which was like a little pound cake/slice of heaven. My son enjoyed a chocolate frosted glazed with sprinkles and orange juice. We will definitely be coming back!"
229,250,1,743,"One of my new favorite haunts. The good thing about living at Mill & Southern is a great bar selection within a block or so, OK so I'm into dive bars, it's almost heaven. The first time I went into the Timeout, it reminded me of a hundred bars back home in Pittsburgh. I didn't feel alot of personality the first couple times, not until I met and made some friends. It's a bar that plays pool, as you can see by all the trophy's and the bulletin board cluttered with league info. I'm a casual player so it's a little intimidating at first, but everyone there is great. That's the allure; the people. You can't look around and see it in the fixtures, it's the conversations, the eclectic hair, the young, the old, the ones with blue chalk wiped on their pants and spilling PBR as they giggle away. The bartenders are fun and easy on the eyes-Daddy Like!\nAND, last but not least, I dig the jukebox and the tunes that get downloaded, alot of punk, new wave and other tunes that I grew up loving."
70,81,1,222,"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! its a little over priced though which suck especially if you're a student as I am. This place is close to campus so you'd think they'd offer some kind of student discount, buuuuuuut the do NOT! its 18 bucks to go in and I love going here because I am a photographer but that adds up after awhile"
65,71,1,3704,"Yum\n\nThis place is very good and very authentic. Initially I was upset they were out of the pork tamales, but the chicken tamal was excellent I also had a few bites of a pork chili relleno and nothing could describe it other than amazing. I have returned a few times and it is always good!"
20,21,1,6707,Great food. The spinach salad is great. Price is a little on the high side.
106,114,1,3443,"You must get the loaded bake potatoes soup. Best I've ever had!!\n\nBlack Angus is one of my favorite restaurants. They only have a few in Arizona so I take every chance I get to eat there. The appetizers, drinks, and entrees are great. The service at this specific Black Angus was also superb. Very friendly and quick. We were there for lunch so I believe he understood we had a time limit. The booths are nice and big so it is a great place for a big party."
69,72,1,6553,My favorite place to go to club. The atmosphere is awesome. It is tried to be replicated at other places on the strip but nothing is like this place. I would go back over and over.  Go to encore beach club EARLY so you can get in. otherwise you will end up paying lots of money to get into the club.
90,92,1,1780,"I'm not usually one for small restaurants, especially in unfamiliar areas, but I heard about Uncle Joe's pizza on a travel site and decided to try it. My family loved it. I had never been to down town before, and it was fairly easy to find. It was great food at a great price and I was disappointed when I returned to Vegas and could not make it back to downtown to eat here. I definitely recommend it!"
55,60,1,1188,You can usually find a line coming out of this place during weekday lunches and breakfast. I was lucky enough that this morning there wasn't.  I got my chicken minis hot and fresh. My only complaint as always is why don't they serve chicken minis all day?
44,47,1,7277,Service at local was excellent and friendly. The eggs Benedict was amazing and had a nice take with the asparagus and potato pancake addition. Excellent home fries with red peppers and onion. Would definitely recommend and go again.
73,75,1,9593,Food was good as always. It was pretty busy all the available tables were dirty. Let manager know he cleaned a table for us right away. Then our food took longer than it should have to get out. I am giving 4 stars because even though there was issues the manager recognized it without us complaining and gave us free entree certificates and was very apologetic.
12,16,1,6187,Lasagna is good. Pizzas and salads are average.
33,33,1,7471,My daughter loves the lesson by the teacher. Also she loves the summer camp. She already asked me to sign in the camp in this Phoenix Music Lessons.
78,81,1,8863,"We came here for my birthday and had a fantastic time. The service was top notch and the food was delicious. We had a bacon board which was amazing.  There were five of us and we were able to try several menu items. We had pulled pork, turkey, and prime rib along with our appetizer. The food was really delicious and tasty. We will definitely be back."
18,18,1,7107,The Best pizza in Vegas. Try the white one. Also beer on tap.

69,78,1,6410,Its really hard to trust people when working with your car. They either upscale you or try to sell you things that you dont need. Joe was true and honest with his price. His work is worth the money spent. As with other reviews on here I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND DC Window Tint for your cars tinting needs. Thanks again Joe.
67,71,1,4862,"This is our favorite Mexican joint in town. The food and service is consistently good. The sauces seem to have gotten spicier over time, or so it seems!  Definitely try the green sauce- it's delicious and super spicy at the same time. The wait can seem long at times but its usually no longer than 15 minutes."
30,31,1,2072,I have been coming here for years ! I love this place ! Amazing food ! I absolutely love everything about it ! It's like home !
25,27,1,4174,I love chicago dogs. They do them pretty good too. I love the gyros as well. never been disappointed!
187,201,1,353,"Sadly, I missed dinner service here so a couple of associates and I grabbed a late-night dessert at this lovely Italian restaurant.\n\nWe were very impressed with the atmosphere of this restaurant. Although we chose to sit outside, the location proved to be very hidden and private-- perfect spot to take your date! Our server was perfect and extremely attentive. Even though he knew we were only ordering desserts, he still took the time to go through their best options. We decided to go with a couple glasses of wine, some coffee, and a Tiramisu to share. The attention on our table was never lost, in fact, as the night grew chilly, our server came back and helped move a heat lamp closer to our table to keep warm.\n\nThe Tiramisu was excellent and I'm truly sorry to say I wasn't able to experience more of their great food! Will definitely be back on the next trip!"
80,84,1,1862,I am afraid to tell anyone else about this place as then it will be too busy and the prices will be raised - but I also want them to stay in business as i just bought a house in vegas. East Coast - the real deal. try it once - you'll be back. Do not go for the ambiance - in fact - get take out. It's just the best.
55,64,1,3910,"Gelato Dolce Vita has the best gelato in Arizona.  I've been to Italy & this gelato is as good as what you will find in Rome, Florence, or Venice.  A lot of flavors to choose from!!!  Home made & well prepared.  Good, friendly atmosphere."
54,56,1,4772,"I don't get why so many people here say it's a bad place. Personally I think this is one of the best Chinese sit down restaurant walking distance from U Waterloo. The menu has many choices, taste is decent, and the dishes are fairly priced."
41,44,1,4894,Great view!  Very close to the runway so it's good for pictures.  Picnic tables and benches to eat or just relax. You'll find lots of kids here especially on a nice weekend day.
348,381,1,239,"I've been popping into the George and Dragon nearly every Thursday since last April for trivia nights.  I like the place.  The trivia host is entertaining and the place feels worn in, but not worn down.  I feel comfortable and welcome every time I visit.  Most weeks I end up ordering a couple beers from the rather large selection.  The drink prices, while high for some people's tastes, are comparable to what I've seen in other places.  Imports are going to cost more, it's the price you pay to have a selection of Boddington's, Murphy's and Guinness all in one place, among other things.\n\nNormally on trivia nights I don't end up getting food, as although I find their portions proportional to the prices, I don't feel I need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting.  I have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions I've grabbed some eats, for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended.  The dragon wings are another of my favorite, spicy but not overwhelming.  The fish and chips, as previously mentioned, are served on a giant platter and have generally been excellent.\n\nI recommend at least one visit to this bar.  Don't be scared off by the divey look of the pub-front.  The F.C. scarves adorning the ceiling, British booze advertisements on the walls, and the cozy but not claustrophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert.  If you do visit, pop in on a trivia night so you can listen to the host demean the guests with some clever snide remarks and give yourself an entertaining diversion for a night.  Who knows, you may become a regular before you know it."
104,118,1,4189,"Overall good experience. Loved the garlic tapenade and bread, paired with a 2009 Louis Martini Cab.\n\nCaesar salad was ok, a little watery instead of pasty bold flavor, fixed with a little extra dressing.\n\nI ordered the Rib Eye Special, the husband ordered Pasta with sausage, neither were memorable. Our friends enjoyed the Chilean Sea Bass and Lasagna\n\nOur waiter Glenn was good and accommodating.\nWe didn't care for Francisco the asst. waiter, limited English and not helpful."
62,65,1,6453,"Very professional, uses clean disposable products for the makeup application. Makeup turned out very beautiful and the way she did my hair, unbelievable and it seems effortlessly too. Was very happy with the look. Nikki is really nice and I definitely recommends her to everyone. I will definitely come back! Thanks Nikki!"
48,51,1,4428,Great Bloody Mary's and 5 bucks is a great price considering the location. I was very thankful for the celery. For some reason so many bars leave that out but the Le Petite Bar is on their game. Keep it up!
88,90,1,5388,"I love the Apple Dumpling Cafe. The food is wonderful and the staff is warm and friendly. I recently had an issue with an item that I ordered that was not to my satisfaction. I spoke with the owner regarding the issue. He listened to my complaint, corrected the problem and really made me feel like he cared about his customers. Overall the Apple Dumpling Cafe gets my stamp of approval and recommend you go and check it out!"
